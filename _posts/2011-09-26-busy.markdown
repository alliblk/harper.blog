It has been about nine months since I last posted on this blog. I promise 
I haven't completely forgotten about it. Strangely I find myself rather 
busy. I imagine it has something to do with my amazing job helping to
reelect the President. 

I hope to post again soon (hah. who am I kidding. It will be many moons before I post again!). In the meantime, please feel free to hit me up on
twitter [@harper](http://twitter.com/harper) and donate to my [personal fundraising page](https://donate.barackobama.com/page/outreach/view/2012/harper).
