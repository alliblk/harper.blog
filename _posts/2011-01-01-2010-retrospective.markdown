2010 was a great year. I rarely write these retrospectives (only [2008](http://www.nata2.org/2009/01/04/2008-retrospectiv/) I think), but i think about writing them every year. It is so cheesey, but also a fun exercise in memory and retrospection. 

So.. here goes. First, some stats:

## Social ##
*   Twitter
    *   I tweeted an average of **12 times a day**.
    *   The most tweets I tweeted was **52** on [January 10th](http://harperreed.org/activity?date=2010-01-10). This was one of my first days hanging out at Rackspace. Apparently I was enjoying hanging out with all my friends. 
*   Foursquare
    *   I checked into an average of **2 places a day**.
    *   The most checkins in a single day was **9** checkins on [March 14th](http://harperreed.org/activity?date=2010-03-14) during the checkin frenzy that is SXSW. 
*   Flickr Photos
    *   I uploaded an average of **1 photo per day**.
    *   The most photos I uploaded in a single day was on [July 20th](http://harperreed.org/activity?date=2010-07-20) when I scanned and uploaded **100** of my ticket stubs. Check out the [set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/sets/72157624542393586/).
*   Google Reader Shares
    *   I shared an average of **10 shares a day**.
    *   The most shares in a single day was **50 shares** on [January 7th]. It was my first day in San Antonio and I apparently was waiting to go into the office. 

## Health ##
*   I tracked my weight **263 days** and my steps **142 days**. I wasn't very good at tracking my sleep, I only tracked **65 nights**.
*   This is aweosme.
*   Sleep
    *   Of the nights tracked, I slept an average of **7.1 hours**.
    *   My average bedtime was **2:18 am**.
*   Steps
    *   On average I do an average of **7197 steps a day**. That is about **3.4 miles per day**.
    *   I was a gigantic slacker on [July 28th](http://harperreed.org/activity?date=2010-07-28) and only took **203 steps**.
    *   On [August 9th](http://harperreed.org/activity?date=2010-08-9) I did about **21423 steps**. I was at a lollapalooza afterparty and dancing my ass off. It was awesome.
*   Weight
    *   My weight in 2010 was hilarious. It was all over the place. Check out this [graph](http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/5232405147/).
    *   I started out at about **178 lbs** in the beginning of 2010. 
    *   On [June 6th](http://harperreed.org/activity?date=2010-06-6) I was the heaviest I was in 2010 at **180 lbs**. 
    *   My goal was **170 lbs** and I achieved that around October 2010. On [October 29th](http://harperreed.org/activity?date=2010-10-29) I weighed in at **166.9 lbs**, the least I weighed during 2010. 
    *   I currently weight **172.5 lbs** and I blame the holidays and candy. 

## Travel ##
*   I traveled more in 2010 than I have any year previous. I was out of Chicago around **88 days**. That is about **23.84% of the year** away from home.
*   Of the **87 days**, I spent **68 days** (**18.63% of the year**) traveling in the US and **20 days** (**5.48% of the year**) traveling internationally. 
*   Within the **68 days** spent traveling in the United States I spent time in the following states: California (**4.66% of the year**), Texas (**7.40%**), Colorado (**5.48%**), Massachusetts (**0.82%**) and New Mexico (**0.27%**).
*   I spent **20 days** (**5.48% of the year**) in Japan. [It was amazing](http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/sets/72157625598388247/).
