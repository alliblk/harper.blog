    <p><a title="Nokia 1100 and Motorola F3 by nata2, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/4283555038/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4039/4283555038_a798542c5f_m.jpg" alt="Nokia 1100 and Motorola F3" width="240" height="218" align="right" /></a></p>

<p>I love mobile phones. I don't know why - but mobile devices represent so much of what I love about technology. The ubiquity, the fascination, all the new technology that pops up and all the different way people use their devices. I also feel like mobile devices will be the future of whatever the internet turns out to be. They will power the internet. With all this in mind - I have started to become interested in the devices that fill the opposite niche. The devices that are SO simple that their are almost NO features.</p>

<p>These are not Razrs, or other shitty mobile devices which act like they have all sorts of amazing features. Â These specific phones are single feature, cheap devices and are often deployed in developing countries.</p>

<p>There are two that I really enjoy and I suggest checking out.</p>

<p>The first is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_1100">Nokia 1100</a>. Also known as my favorite phone in the world. I first saw this phone while working for <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/sets/72057594078282161/">a minute in Bangalore</a>. It was advertised as a phone "<a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/india/article.cfm?articleid=4358">made for india</a>" and apparently was hardy enough to be used by the working class there. I was drawn to the device. I neeeeeded it. It's weird, because at the time I was running a symbian device that supported about every possible feature available in mobile - so thinking about jumping to a mobile device that was pretty much featureless was crazy. But - I was compelled.</p>

<p>The phone isn't that fancy. It has very few features. It is super tiny and is super cheap. It is just a basic, simple phone that does nothing more than look "Nokia" and probably makes calls. The features it has are incredibly handy: flashlight, alarm clock and sms messaging.</p>

<p>I didn't realize it then, but the Nokia 1100 is possibly the most popular electronic device in the world. According to the infallible wikipedia: Nokia has sold ~200 million of the Nokia 1100s since it's launch in 2003. To put it in perspective - there have been ~30MM iPhones sold and ~50MM Razrs sold.</p>

<p>I eventually got a couple of these and used them as lenders, experiments and generaly fucking around phones. I even sent one to my brother for him to use - which he eventually washed in a washing machine - it still boots. They are HARDY. and 20 bucks.</p>

<p>The second phone that I am interested in is a bit newer and is  a bit more tech. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_FONE_F3">Motorola F3</a>. My buddy <a href="http://thinkmoreinc.wordpress.com/2009/03/19/50-2/">Hemmant showed it to me</a>, told me a bit about the history and I couldn't stop thinking about it. Anecdotally, this phone was made by a Motorola team in india - again for use in the developing countries market. It is simple, has no features (even less than the 1100) and is JUST a phone. There is one major differentiator. The Motorola f3 is one of the only phones to have an e-ink display. This means that it uses very little power in standby (standby time of ~17 days), can be used in low light/no light situations and is rather resilient. The phone didn't sell as many as the Nokia 1100 - in fact it was a veritable failure.</p>

<p>The F3 has no features. It barely send txt messages. It has voice prompts for all menus. It is just a phone. A user serviceable, easy to charge, thin, e-ink phone. It works well making calls and receiving txt messages. The F3 would be an amazing phone for a child, elderly person or someone who doesn't want to deal with learning pesky features. I got one for my "go bag" as an emergency phone (I am not a survivalist, I just crush a lot).</p>

<p>You can find an unlocked <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013A7KMW?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=nata2productions&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0013A7KMW">Motorola f3 for about 30 bucks on amazon</a>. I suggest you get one.</p>
