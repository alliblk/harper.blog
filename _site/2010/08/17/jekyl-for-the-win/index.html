  <div class="postcontent">
    <p>I don't like to move my blog around. It is super annoying. The RSS feed gets all messed up, I spend months tweaking everything. I find silly bugs and then fascinate about fixing them. All in all it takes months to complete the process. I avoid it like the plague.</p>

<p>However, I really wanted something simpler than wordpress. I didn’t need a CMS. I barely need a blogging engine. I update so infrequently. I want something that creates well formed html (hah), static content and is easy to use.</p>

<p>I started looking into hosting this blog on Google’s app engine awhile ago. I looked into <a href="http://bloog.billkatz.com/" title="Bloog">Bloog</a> - an awesome restful bloggin engine for app engine. It was very hopeful. i spent a bunch of time hacking on it and eventually ported my theme over. I didn’t feel it though. it worked well. it had all the features i wanted. It even used a bunch of neat app engine tricks. I gave up on using it for my blog. It just wasn’t the correct choice.</p>

<p>During this time, I watched most of my hackerish friends start to use Jekyll to power their blogs (or write and then use <a href="http://github.com/aconbere/igor" title="igor">igor</a> as <a href="http://anders.conbere.org/">anders</a> did (protip: do not search for “anders jekyll” in google)). I admired the simplicity of the jekyll engine. It was so easy and fun to use. I wanted to use it for my blog - but it didn’t play as nicely with app engine as i had hoped.</p>

<p>I then found Drydrop.</p>

<p>DryDrop is a neat application for app engine that let’s you host static content. In my current phase of life, I really hate managing servers. It is fun and all - but if i don’t have to - i am not going to. ;) Instead, I try and use platform as a service services(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAS_syndrome">heh</a>) to minimize the number of servers that I touch on a daily basis (my current server number is 4 (I secretly want it to grow back to 100+)). DryDrop was a nice solution for my server hatred. It allowed me to serve simple static content on app engine. I immediately ported a bunch of my static sites over to app engine: <a href="http://www.harpercloud.com/">harpercloud.com</a>, <a href="http://www.biofuelmenace.com/">biofuelmenace.com</a>, <a href="http://weownthesun.com">weownthesun.com</a> and of course <a href="http://www.ryankanno.com">ryankanno.com</a>.</p>

<p>After a few weeks with these sites on app engine - I decided that it was probably the right place to put my precious blog.</p>

<p><a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/">Jekyll</a> is an interesting beast. It is exactly as the wiki proclaims: <a href="http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll/">a simple, blog aware, static site generator</a>. It has no features (well. a couple), it has no built in community aspects (no commenting, trackbacks, reactions, etc). It doesn’t have any admin. it is just a static site generator that is geared for blog like sites. It works amazingly.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was port my theme over to Jekyll. You can check this out at my <a href="http://github.com/harperreed/harperreed-blog">blogs git repository</a>. It was a pain in the ass, but i was able to clean up a bunch of annoying HTML issues that i had from changing shit all the time. I still need to refactor it a bunch.</p>

<p>Once the theme was done, I started working on the content. This is the biggest issue. I have a bunch of content. Like 1000s of posts. Jekyll is not necessarily the quickest of generators when you have thousands of posts. Luckily I was able to do some simple tricks to ensure that the old posts work and the new posts work as well. Its honestly pretty annoying and i need to solve this better.</p>

<p>A couple hints for hosting Jekyll on App Engine with DryDrop:
* check out <a href="http://thelab.carlsverre.com/2010/02/09/static-hosting">this post</a> by <a href="http://www.carlsverre.com/">Carl Sverre</a> on tweaking the site.yaml file for drydrop to handle the pretty permalinks
* the wordpress migration script that jekyll uses is pretty nice. i <a href="http://github.com/harperreed/harperreed-blog/blob/master/_import/wordpress.rb">hacked mine to export tags and datetime</a> as well.
* there are hundreds of blog posts just like this one. they all have great hints
* if you get stuck, just check out the <a href="http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll/sites">list of sites that are using jekyll</a>. Often they have source on github. you can glean all sorts of goodness from them.</p>

<p><strong>It is a bummer to leave wordpress. </strong></p>

<p>I have been on wordpress since early 2005. I think that is the longest I have stayed with 1 piece of software. I really enjoy the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/">wordpress community</a>. I really like <a href="http://ma.tt/">matt</a> and all he has done for open source and the internet. I like the <a href="http://drewblas.com/2010/07/15/an-analysis-of-gpled-code-in-thesis/">fights they pick</a> and i enjoy the <a href="http://buddypress.org/">innovations they are bringing to blogging</a>. I don’t like having to <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=wordpress+exploit">fight hackers</a> off every single day. If there was one reason i am abandoning wordpress it is because of the hackers.</p>

<p>I hosted about 25 wordpress blogs on my mosso account for various friends. I kept most of them up to date, but a lot of them were for friends and were not under my control. 100% of them got owned. hah. It was just something they did. no matter how fast or often i updated the wordpress software - it would be owned at least one time. My personal blog was safe for some reason. Maybe it was because I always ran the bleeding edge version from SVN. I will not miss the constant updates and the attacks.  The wordpress community does a good job of handling this issue. I, however, was tired of it.</p>

<p>I migrated at least 22 of the 25 hosted blogs to <a href="http://wordpress.com">wordpress.com</a> or <a href="http://posterous.com">posterous</a>. I killed all the unused wordpress installs. No more hackers getting in through plugins, themes or trickery.</p>

<p>If i were to use wordpress again, I would either use <a href="http://wordpress.com">wordpress.com</a> or <a href="http://vaultpress.com/">vaultpress</a>. Both of those products seem to solve my problems. Right now, however, jekyll has pretty thoroughly solved them.</p>

<p>I can’t wait to start updating this blog a bit more often. I don’t know if i will write like i did in <a href="/2003/">2003</a>/<a href="/2004/">2004</a> - but i plan to update it a bit more than i did in <a href="/2009/">2009</a>. We shall see ;)</p>
