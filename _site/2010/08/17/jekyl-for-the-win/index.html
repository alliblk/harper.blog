<strong>Hi.</strong> I am an engineer who builds paradigm-shifting tech and leads others to do the same. I love using the enormity of the Internet to bring people together, whether as CTO of Obama for America, CTO at Threadless.com, or on my own projects. You can often find me playing with new technology, looking for something to hack, or enjoying life in Chicago with my amazing wife, Hiromi.

  <div class="postcontent">
    <p>I don't like to move my blog around. It is super annoying. The RSS feed gets all messed up, I spend months tweaking everything. I find silly bugs and then fascinate about fixing them. All in all it takes months to complete the process. I avoid it like the plague.</p>

<p>However, I really wanted something simpler than wordpress. I didn’t need a CMS. I barely need a blogging engine. I update so infrequently. I want something that creates well formed html (hah), static content and is easy to use.</p>

<p>I started looking into hosting this blog on Google’s app engine awhile ago. I looked into <a href="http://bloog.billkatz.com/" title="Bloog">Bloog</a> - an awesome restful bloggin engine for app engine. It was very hopeful. i spent a bunch of time hacking on it and eventually ported my theme over. I didn’t feel it though. it worked well. it had all the features i wanted. It even used a bunch of neat app engine tricks. I gave up on using it for my blog. It just wasn’t the correct choice.</p>

<p>During this time, I watched most of my hackerish friends start to use Jekyll to power their blogs (or write and then use <a href="http://github.com/aconbere/igor" title="igor">igor</a> as <a href="http://anders.conbere.org/">anders</a> did (protip: do not search for “anders jekyll” in google)). I admired the simplicity of the jekyll engine. It was so easy and fun to use. I wanted to use it for my blog - but it didn’t play as nicely with app engine as i had hoped.</p>

<p>I then found Drydrop.</p>

<p>DryDrop is a neat application for app engine that let’s you host static content. In my current phase of life, I really hate managing servers. It is fun and all - but if i don’t have to - i am not going to. ;) Instead, I try and use platform as a service services(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAS_syndrome">heh</a>) to minimize the number of servers that I touch on a daily basis (my current server number is 4 (I secretly want it to grow back to 100+)). DryDrop was a nice solution for my server hatred. It allowed me to serve simple static content on app engine. I immediately ported a bunch of my static sites over to app engine: <a href="http://www.harpercloud.com/">harpercloud.com</a>, <a href="http://www.biofuelmenace.com/">biofuelmenace.com</a>, <a href="http://weownthesun.com">weownthesun.com</a> and of course <a href="http://www.ryankanno.com">ryankanno.com</a>.</p>

<p>After a few weeks with these sites on app engine - I decided that it was probably the right place to put my precious blog.</p>

<p><a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/">Jekyll</a> is an interesting beast. It is exactly as the wiki proclaims: <a href="http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll/">a simple, blog aware, static site generator</a>. It has no features (well. a couple), it has no built in community aspects (no commenting, trackbacks, reactions, etc). It doesn’t have any admin. it is just a static site generator that is geared for blog like sites. It works amazingly.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was port my theme over to Jekyll. You can check this out at my <a href="http://github.com/harperreed/harperreed-blog">blogs git repository</a>. It was a pain in the ass, but i was able to clean up a bunch of annoying HTML issues that i had from changing shit all the time. I still need to refactor it a bunch.</p>

<p>Once the theme was done, I started working on the content. This is the biggest issue. I have a bunch of content. Like 1000s of posts. Jekyll is not necessarily the quickest of generators when you have thousands of posts. Luckily I was able to do some simple tricks to ensure that the old posts work and the new posts work as well. Its honestly pretty annoying and i need to solve this better.</p>

<p>A couple hints for hosting Jekyll on App Engine with DryDrop:
* check out <a href="http://thelab.carlsverre.com/2010/02/09/static-hosting">this post</a> by <a href="http://www.carlsverre.com/">Carl Sverre</a> on tweaking the site.yaml file for drydrop to handle the pretty permalinks
* the wordpress migration script that jekyll uses is pretty nice. i <a href="http://github.com/harperreed/harperreed-blog/blob/master/_import/wordpress.rb">hacked mine to export tags and datetime</a> as well.
* there are hundreds of blog posts just like this one. they all have great hints
* if you get stuck, just check out the <a href="http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll/sites">list of sites that are using jekyll</a>. Often they have source on github. you can glean all sorts of goodness from them.</p>

<p><strong>It is a bummer to leave wordpress. </strong></p>

<p>I have been on wordpress since early 2005. I think that is the longest I have stayed with 1 piece of software. I really enjoy the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/">wordpress community</a>. I really like <a href="http://ma.tt/">matt</a> and all he has done for open source and the internet. I like the <a href="http://drewblas.com/2010/07/15/an-analysis-of-gpled-code-in-thesis/">fights they pick</a> and i enjoy the <a href="http://buddypress.org/">innovations they are bringing to blogging</a>. I don’t like having to <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=wordpress+exploit">fight hackers</a> off every single day. If there was one reason i am abandoning wordpress it is because of the hackers.</p>

<p>I hosted about 25 wordpress blogs on my mosso account for various friends. I kept most of them up to date, but a lot of them were for friends and were not under my control. 100% of them got owned. hah. It was just something they did. no matter how fast or often i updated the wordpress software - it would be owned at least one time. My personal blog was safe for some reason. Maybe it was because I always ran the bleeding edge version from SVN. I will not miss the constant updates and the attacks.  The wordpress community does a good job of handling this issue. I, however, was tired of it.</p>

<p>I migrated at least 22 of the 25 hosted blogs to <a href="http://wordpress.com">wordpress.com</a> or <a href="http://posterous.com">posterous</a>. I killed all the unused wordpress installs. No more hackers getting in through plugins, themes or trickery.</p>

<p>If i were to use wordpress again, I would either use <a href="http://wordpress.com">wordpress.com</a> or <a href="http://vaultpress.com/">vaultpress</a>. Both of those products seem to solve my problems. Right now, however, jekyll has pretty thoroughly solved them.</p>

<p>I can’t wait to start updating this blog a bit more often. I don’t know if i will write like i did in <a href="/2003/">2003</a>/<a href="/2004/">2004</a> - but i plan to update it a bit more than i did in <a href="/2009/">2009</a>. We shall see ;)</p>
