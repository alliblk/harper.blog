<strong>Hi.</strong> I am an engineer who builds paradigm-shifting tech and leads others to do the same. I love using the enormity of the Internet to bring people together, whether as CTO of Obama for America, CTO at Threadless.com, or on my own projects. You can often find me playing with new technology, looking for something to hack, or enjoying life in Chicago with my amazing wife, Hiromi. Check out my <a href="http://harperreed.com">homepage</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=harper" target="_blank">follow me on twitter</a>.

    <p>So everyday I walk down some street that is being reconstructed. It is really neat to see civil engineering happen over time. Quite something really. I quite enjoy watching the big machinery move about and crush and build and destroy things. I often time mistake them for dinosaurs. I mean I know they are not dinosaurs.. however they could be. I imagine them being the same size as dinosaurs - and in that flintstones sorta way.. they are being used as dinosarus would be used. It is fun. <br/><br/>Last night I went and saw busta rhymes. and boy oh boy did he bust da rhymes. heh. well. ice cube was in the audience and apparently "eazy-e" was there as well. Which is rather surprising cuz he is dead. or busta accidently exposed the plot that got 2pac and biggie smalls.. as well. hmm.. I wonder.<br/>
<br/>poor john walker... no bail for him.. I guess he shouldn't have acted on his religious wants and needs. It is often hard for me pick a viewpoint or a side in situations like this. It seems that some of these peopl eare being "charged" with being affiliated with the taliban. I get confused though, because I was under the impression that the taliban was as much a religious sect as the Seventh Day Adventists are. So if 5000 of the 7000 seventh day adventists got together and ripped shit up - would the government try and arrest ALL of the SDA? or would they try and arrest the 5000 that broke the law. I don't understand. I am afraid that all of this is too broad. Also.. the U.S.'s foriegn policy is setting a great precident for other countries to follow. I cannot imagine bush sitting still while china takes a bunch of "our" soldiers.. who are "illegal combatants," and mistreats them in a similar respect with what we are doing with afghan people at camp X-ray. What will bush do in that situation.. probably attack.. and then what will we do.. probably die.. wheee.. I love our isolationist foriegn policy.. almost more than I love our enept president.</p>
