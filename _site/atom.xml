   <content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;2013 was rad! Here is some stuff.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, I have no idea how to blog. &lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/oe6MG1W.jpg&quot;&gt;Please bare with me here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a list of awesome things that happened in 2013:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(In absolutely no order)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I hung out with Hiromi a lot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hiromi got promoted. yay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hiromi and I bought a condo in Chicago&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I continued to grow and work at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://modest.com&quot;&gt;company&lt;/a&gt; that Dylan and I founded&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I worked with rad people (and still do!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I purchased a few awesome domains&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I got a better company name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I continued to be a part of a secret cabal of great people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I played around with bitcoins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I played around with home automation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I played around with loud speakers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I learned a lot about &lt;a href=&quot;http://golang.org/&quot;&gt;golang&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I hacked on many raspberry pi boards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I ate at a lot of great restaurants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was on the team that won a Webby&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I made my parents car &lt;a href=&quot;http://zebraprank.com&quot;&gt;zebra striped&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I spoke publically a LOT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I did a TED talk about the future of politics for TED U at TED&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was on TV a lot

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Italy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Singapore&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Australia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Japan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the UK&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was in the news a bunch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was mentioned in a couple of books&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the books talked about how terrible I was&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was on the cover of an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/9005172020/&quot;&gt;italian music magazine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I called German data laws stupid in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zeit.de/2013/42/harper-reed&quot;&gt;german press&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I filmed a game show with a bunch of comedians&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I co-wrote an editorial for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/25/opinion/getting-to-the-bottom-of-healthcaregovs-flop.html?_r=0&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I complained a lot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I played three pro-werewolf games&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I sledded and &lt;a href=&quot;http://derek.broox.com/photos/23568/tagged/harper-reed/&quot;&gt;almost died&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google searches for &quot;&#39;harper reed&#39; speedo&quot; contain more results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I said &quot;awesome&quot; a bit less&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I, unfortunantly, used &quot;lol&quot; in chat more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I traveled a lot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I stayed in many insane hotels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hiromi was able to accompany me on a lot of the trips&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I visited six of the seven continents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I visited the following countries:

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;South Africa&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switzerland&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I became a mileage weirdo and &lt;em&gt;&quot;earned&quot;&lt;/em&gt; status on two airlines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I hung out with a few insane people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I met a bunch of people who I hope to interact with again&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I prepared for 2014&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I ripped all my CDs to FLAC (hopefully for the last time)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I purchased jogging pants jeans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I bought four button up shirts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I purchased a tuxedo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I now own five button up shirts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I listened to a lot of terrible music via some nice headphones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I watched my brother juggle fire&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I got my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkS5r95jJjk&quot;&gt;dad a foghorn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I played around with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pETpJm38rEg&quot;&gt;fiverr a bunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One day on twitter I fixed everyone&#39;s problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One day on twitter I annoyed all of my friends

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ok. I annoyed my friends more than one day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I made a lot of jokes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I went to inauguration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I went to a White House holiday party&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I purchased a couple meteorites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I met a guy who has the largest meteorite collection in the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I talked to a brother about meteorites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I participated in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/friend-fracker-tests-your-facebook-friendships-by-randomly-deleting-them&quot;&gt;Seven on Seven competition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I got a couples massage with a world famous artist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I got asked about the NSA a lot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I learned a lot about the NSA from various new sources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I spent a bit of time at News Limited and The Guardian&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I communicated via PGP way more than 2012&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I hated using GPG&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I never found an answer to why I track a lot of data about myself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I continued to track a lot of data about myself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I tweeted 7,722 times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I retweeted 1,585 people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I completed 63 books on my Kindle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I walked 1,620,867 steps according to my fitbit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That seems to be about 5,178 steps a day

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I only wore my fitbit 313 days :(&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I lost two pounds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I used public transportation 530 times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I listened to 16,904 songs according to Last.fm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I uploaded 647 photos to flickr, instagram or twitter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I ignored linkedin and facebook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I forgot a lot of cool stuff that I did in 2013&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I did not post one blog entry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I imagine I forgot a lot of awesome things. It was a great year. I can&#39;t wait for 2014!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yay!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some pictures from the 2013:&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have been waiting for this moment for 1 year and 8 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We reelected the President.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/8172451244/&quot; title=&quot;... by nata2, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8481/8172451244_69b2f80765.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; alt=&quot;...&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you to everyone who helped out. It was amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Me on The Setup: Harper Reed uses this.</title>
   <link href="http://www.nata2.org/2012/02/11/the-setup-harperreed-uses-this/"/>
   <updated>2012-02-11T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.nata2.org/2012/02/11/the-setup-harperreed-uses-this</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h3&gt;Preface&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been following &lt;a href=&quot;http://usesthis.com&quot;&gt;The Setup&lt;/a&gt; for quite awhile. I love learning about the &lt;strong&gt;how&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;what&lt;/strong&gt; of getting things done. The Setup does such a great job of shifting the dialog to the objects that are behind the action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as a long time reader, I was stoked when Daniel (aka &lt;a href=&quot;http://waferbaby.com&quot;&gt;waferbaby&lt;/a&gt;) reached out and asked if I would like to do an interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I have included it here, please &lt;a href=&quot;http://harper.reed.usesthis.com/&quot;&gt;check it out&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://usesthis.com&quot;&gt;The Setup&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;My interview for &lt;a href=&quot;http://usesthis.com&quot;&gt;The Setup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Who are you, and what do you do? (Try to keep this brief!)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am &lt;a href=&quot;http://harperreed.org&quot;&gt;Harper Reed&lt;/a&gt;. I make things happen on the internet. I am a connector and a technologist. I like to meld both of those things together to connect people to one another and enable them to build amazing technology. In the past I spent a bunch of time helping &lt;a href=&quot;http://threadless.com&quot;&gt;Threadless&lt;/a&gt; grow, then I helped &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sandboxindustries.com/&quot;&gt;startups&lt;/a&gt; in Chicago &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.exceleratelabs.com/&quot;&gt;grow&lt;/a&gt;, and now I am helping &lt;a href=&quot;http://barackobama.com&quot;&gt;reelect the president&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;What hardware are you using?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I typically have two workstations that I keep in sync via &lt;a href=&quot;http://dropbox.com&quot;&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://git-scm.com/&quot;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt;. In the past, I have relied on a trusty &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad#X_series&quot;&gt;Lenovo X series&lt;/a&gt; laptop running &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ubuntu.com/&quot;&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt; that I carry with me and then a workstation at home that is some form of macbook pro/mac mini. I used this setup for many years and loved it. Recently, because I fell in love with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Air#Design&quot;&gt;Macbook Air form factor&lt;/a&gt;, I migrated away from the lenovo and ubuntu in favor of a tiny happy &lt;a href=&quot;http://support.apple.com/kb/SP631&quot;&gt;11&quot; Macbook Air (i7)&lt;/a&gt;. It works well. For my desktop workstation I am using a late-model &lt;a href=&quot;http://support.apple.com/kb/SP632&quot;&gt;Mac Mini (i7)&lt;/a&gt; paired with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.samsung.com/ph/consumer/monitor-peripherals-printer/monitor/lcd-monitor/LS23MYZKFNA/XP/index.idx?pagetype=prd_detail&quot;&gt;Samsung SyncMaster 2343 monitor&lt;/a&gt;. It looks great and doesn&#39;t take up too much space on my desk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I obsess about bags. My daily driver is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chromebagsstore.com/bags/laptop-bags/buran.html&quot;&gt;black on black Chrome Buran bag&lt;/a&gt;. It is a very good bag. It isn&#39;t too fancy or clever. It just works. I sometimes travel using an &lt;a href=&quot;http://countycomm.com/minebag.html&quot;&gt;EOD mini utility bag&lt;/a&gt;. It fits my air, power cord and a change of clothes. Recently a friend picked up a &lt;a href=&quot;http://defybags.com/urban-cowboy.html&quot;&gt;Defy Urban Cowboy bag&lt;/a&gt;. It has an amazing buckle and fits the air perfectly.  Inside of these bags, my air lives in its own &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.etsy.com/shop/packandsmooch&quot;&gt;Pack and Smooch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.etsy.com/listing/62891440/11-inch-macbook-air-sleeve-hampshire-lts&quot;&gt;Hampshire pouch&lt;/a&gt;. It is felt and leather and was designed to not scratch up your air. Looks great too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my bag, I have a few organizational aids. I wrap up my Air power cord using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quirky.com/products/15-PowerCurl-Mac-Cord-Manager&quot;&gt;Quirky PowerCurl&lt;/a&gt; (I love it because it is handy and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing&quot;&gt;crowdsourced&lt;/a&gt;). I keep a lot of miscellaneous cords, and whatnot in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.service.kleintools.com/Tools/PRD/Category/Zipper%20Bag%20-%20Canvas%20TOOLBAGS-CANVASTLBG-ZIPPERCNVS/Product/5139&quot;&gt;Klein Tools canvas utility bag&lt;/a&gt;. It is handy to have a bag in my main bag to stuff things that will normally get lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At work I listen to a pair of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aiaiai.dk/store/headphones/tma-1&quot;&gt;AiAiAi TMA-1&lt;/a&gt; powered by a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ebay.com/sch/juice2214/m.html?_nkw=&amp;amp;_armrs=1&amp;amp;_from=&amp;amp;_ipg=&amp;amp;_trksid=p3686#ptm250917156510&quot;&gt;candy tin headphone amp&lt;/a&gt;. At home I listen to a pair of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gradolabs.com/page_headphones.php?item=f4ba8830232696b5f580bd531134b668&quot;&gt;Grado sr60i&lt;/a&gt;. I find that the Grado  headphones are quite noisy for people around me compared to the TMA-1s. Both are fine. I carry in my bag a pair of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shure.com/americas/products/earphones-headphones/se-models/se115-sound-isolating-earphones&quot;&gt;Shure SE115 earphones&lt;/a&gt; for use when commuting or flying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a mobile comminucations, my primary device is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iphone_4s&quot;&gt;iPhone 4S&lt;/a&gt;. I use Sprint for the carrier so that I can take advantage of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/googlevoice/sprint/&quot;&gt;Sprint/Google Voice integration&lt;/a&gt;.  This enables me to switch between my android phone (a well used &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_S&quot;&gt;Nexus S&lt;/a&gt; on T-mobile) and my iPhone whenever I feel like it.  The iPhone is an amazing device. The camera is outstanding, the app ecosystem is great, the OS is frustrating. ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I aggressively use my &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Kindle&quot;&gt;Kindle&lt;/a&gt;. I am a &lt;a href=&quot;http://harperreed.org/books&quot;&gt;voracious reader&lt;/a&gt; and the kindle is my constant companion on the quest to consume as many books as possible. The kindle has been a magical device for me. Besides being able to instantly start new books, I love how single purpose the kindle is. It makes it very easy to read books (as it should). I imagine that it will eventually become the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diamond_Age&quot;&gt;Young Lady&#39;s Illustrated Primer&lt;/a&gt; that I want so badly. Until then, it will be my book consuming machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick note on Kindles: I have owned the suite of Kindle devices. The best kindle they have made is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Kindle#Kindle&quot;&gt;Kindle 4&lt;/a&gt; (also known as the cheap kindle). After using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/#!/zachklein/status/1192280043&quot;&gt;Aztec Kindle&lt;/a&gt;, the various Kindles with keyboards and finally the Kindle touch - I find that I am able to be a happier and more efficient reader with the cheaper kindle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;And what software?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try and keep a pretty simple software catalog. I don&#39;t want too many apps clogging my various tubes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To browse the interwebs, I use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/chrome&quot;&gt;Google Chrome&lt;/a&gt;. I edit all sorts of documents with &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi&quot;&gt;Vi&lt;/a&gt; (I really like &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.google.com/p/macvim/&quot;&gt;MacVim&lt;/a&gt; + &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/carlhuda/janus&quot;&gt;Janus&lt;/a&gt; on OSX). I use iTunes to listen to locally stored music. I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichat&quot;&gt;ichat&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adium&quot;&gt;adium&lt;/a&gt; (on OSX) or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gajim&quot;&gt;Gajim&lt;/a&gt; (ubuntu) for messaging; for IRC, I use  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scrollz.com/&quot;&gt;Scrollz&lt;/a&gt; (inside &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Screen&quot;&gt;screen&lt;/a&gt; (thinking about migrating to &lt;a href=&quot;http://tmux.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;tmux&lt;/a&gt;) on a shell). I use whatever generic terminal is available for my shells. To make my shell experience on OSX bearable, I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew&quot;&gt;homebrew&lt;/a&gt; (I shudder to think how things used to be on OSX). I use &lt;a href=&quot;http://dropbox.com/&quot;&gt;dropbox&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://git-scm.com/&quot;&gt;git&lt;/a&gt; to keep things wrapped together. I have been experimenting with keeping my data in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_image#Sparse_bundle&quot;&gt;encrypted sparse bundles&lt;/a&gt; stored in git/dropbox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside the browser I use a bunch of software to get things done. I rely on &lt;a href=&quot;http://google.com/a/&quot;&gt;Google Apps&lt;/a&gt; for a lot (mail, docs, collaboration, sms, voice, etc).  I use &lt;a href=&quot;http://simplenoteapp.com&quot;&gt;simple note&lt;/a&gt; to keep track of random thoughts on my phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love and use &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;. I was not a git convert at first, but github made sharing code and working collaboratively better than ever. It is an amazing tool. I now use git everyday and it has made me a better developer and collaborator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some strange reason, I use both &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Cloud_Drive#Cloud_Player&quot;&gt;Amazon Cloudplayer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_Beta_by_Google&quot;&gt;Google Music&lt;/a&gt;. They are functionally almost exactly the same and I have similar music collections on both. I switch arbitrarily between them. I purchase most of my music from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_MP3&quot;&gt;Amazon MP3&lt;/a&gt;. I also listen to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rdio&quot;&gt;RDIO&lt;/a&gt; when I am lazy. I listen to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hype_Machine&quot;&gt;hype machine&lt;/a&gt; more often than I should.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite killer apps is &lt;a href=&quot;http://partycapp.appspot.com&quot;&gt;partychat&lt;/a&gt;. It is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.google.com/p/partychapp/&quot;&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt; jabber based persistent chat room. It works with google talk and is VERY simple. I use this to communicate with small groups of friends/collaborators. It has allowed &lt;a href=&quot;http://kntd.us&quot;&gt;us&lt;/a&gt; to collaborate on some amazing things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;What would be your dream setup?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am lucky and am pretty happy with my current setup. I would easily add faster internet, more memory, smaller devices, better battery life and more general device convergence. also the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity&quot;&gt;singularity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dream setup from when I was in high school is more interesting. I spent hours drooling over the advertisements in the back of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Shopper_(US_magazine&quot;&gt;Computer Shopper&lt;/a&gt; planning for this very question. For the processor, I wanted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_80486DX2&quot;&gt;486 DX2 66&lt;/a&gt;. I needed enough RAM to run &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/2&quot;&gt;OS/2 2.0&lt;/a&gt; well (not warp!). To support the advanced graphics that OS/2 demanded, I wanted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_Nine_Visual_Technology#Number_Nine_Video_Cards_using_S3_Graphics_Processors&quot;&gt;number nine GXE 64 graphics card&lt;/a&gt;. I desperately wanted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_Blaster_AWE64&quot;&gt;Sound Blaster AWE64 sound card&lt;/a&gt; to play &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module_file&quot;&gt;mods&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id_Software&quot;&gt;id games&lt;/a&gt;. I also needed a crazy &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZyXEL#Products&quot;&gt;ZyXEL 14.4 Modem&lt;/a&gt; to dial into my local telnet drops and BBSes. The eventual goal was to triple boot &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slackware&quot;&gt;Slackware Linux&lt;/a&gt; (sooo many disks), OS/2 and windows 95. At some point around &#39;94 I achieved most of this, however OS/2 had faded away as a priority and I spent most of my time in Linux (thank goodness).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;What do you use? I would love to know. Feel free to comment and let me know.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been about nine months since I last posted on this blog. I promise I haven&#39;t completely forgotten about it. I am so busy that when I have a quick second to  think about posting - I am suddenly thinking about the next thing and the thoughts about my blog have disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am busy because of the awesome work I am doing with all the amazing people at &lt;a href=&quot;http://barackobama.com&quot;&gt;Obama for America&lt;/a&gt;. Although, I miss writing articles about my coding and traveling, I love (and more importantly believe in) the work we are doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will attempt to write a meaningful post soon (hah. who am I kidding. It will be many moons before I post again!). In the meantime, please feel free to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=@harper+yo&quot;&gt;hit me up&lt;/a&gt; on twitter (I am  &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=harper&quot;&gt;@harper&lt;/a&gt;), check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://harperreed.org/books&quot;&gt;books I am reading&lt;/a&gt; and give to my &lt;a href=&quot;https://donate.barackobama.com/page/outreach/view/2012/harper&quot;&gt;personal fundraising page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>OMG FREE HOSTING: How to use GAE to host static sites for free</title>
   <link href="http://www.nata2.org/2011/01/26/how-to-use-app-engine-to-host-static-sites-for-free/"/>
   <updated>2011-01-26T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.nata2.org/2011/01/26/how-to-use-app-engine-to-host-static-sites-for-free</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am constantly telling my friends about the new technology tricks that I learn in my internet travels. I learn a lot, which has caused my friends to ignore around 90% of what I say about technology. I don&#39;t mind, because I know that I am a genius(heh) and they will come around some day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is exactly what happened with my most recent hacked upon hosting setup. I told my buddy &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/ryankanno&quot;&gt;kanno&lt;/a&gt;, and he didn&#39;t pay attention. Then he started diving in a bit on his own. Once he experienced a taste of the magic, I helped him to the rest of the koolaid and he was hooked. The result was him begging me to do this post to help people understand how awesome this setup is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The problem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate hosting. I hate (really love - but love to hate) servers. I &lt;strong&gt;reallllllllllllllllllly&lt;/strong&gt; like not having to deal with scaling, servers, server software and all that magic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides servers and dealing with the tech side of hosting, I really hate paying for hosting. I especially hate paying to host sites that will get no traffic and will not change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of the sites I am talking about:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fastmilo.com&quot;&gt;fastmilo.com&lt;/a&gt; - this site gets 21 visits a year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chicagocanoeclub.com&quot;&gt;chicagocanoeclub.com&lt;/a&gt; - this site gets 13 visits a year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.weownthesun.com/&quot;&gt;weownthesun.com&lt;/a&gt; - this site gets 8 visits a year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.harpercloud.com/&quot;&gt;harpercloud.com&lt;/a&gt; - this site gets 5 visits a year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nutpunt.com/&quot;&gt;nutpunt.com&lt;/a&gt; - this site gets 3 visits a year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stevereed.org/&quot;&gt;stevereed.org&lt;/a&gt; - this site gets 2 visits a year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.noahleaks.com/&quot;&gt;noahleaks.com&lt;/a&gt; - this site gets 1 visits a year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.biofuelmenace.com/&quot;&gt;biofuelmenace.com&lt;/a&gt; - this site gets 1 visits a year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Basically simple one or multiple page joke/history/ego sites. Easy to make, no maintenance and no dynamic content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were all hosted at Rackspace Cloud Sites for the longest time. I got tired of paying $100 bucks just to host stupid stuff. I thought about moving them all to one tiny linode/slice/ec2/rackspace cloud box - but that would have been more than $100/month of maintenance. It also wouldn&#39;t have solved the problem for me. I would still be paying to host these sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as I was about to give up and delete myself from the internet completely - in walks &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/appengine/&quot;&gt;App Engine&lt;/a&gt; with its fancy pants friend, &lt;a href=&quot;http://drydrop.binaryage.com&quot;&gt;DryDrop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;DryDrop is an easy way to host static content on App Engine&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://drydrop.binaryage.com&quot;&gt;DryDrop&lt;/a&gt; is at its most basic form a bucket that holds the various pieces of a static site, and serves the pieces when they are requested. It is git backed for easy content management. It is mostly for nerds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href=&quot;http://drydrop.binaryage.com&quot;&gt;DryDrop site&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;DryDrop is a tool that lets you host your static site on Google App Engine and update it by pushing to GitHub. Thanks to GitHub post-receive hooks your App Engine site can be updated automatically when you push new content.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/dansinker&quot;&gt;@dansinker&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;it&#39;s a tool that you install on AppEngine that lets you publish web pages on Google&#39;s servers using nothing but github.
So like, I update the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chicagomayoralscorecard.com/&quot;&gt;Scorecard&lt;/a&gt; simply by typing &quot;git push&quot; and suddenly, WHOOOOSH, the scorecard is updated.
I seriously love it more than is probably healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As their site points out, this means that you can host your static content with zero cost, zero maintenance and very little real tech knowledge (just &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software&quot;&gt;git&lt;/a&gt;), a bit of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rake_(software&quot;&gt;rake&lt;/a&gt;) and some gigantic internet nuts).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DryDrop workflow &lt;a href=&quot;http://drydrop.binaryage.com/#installation&quot;&gt;is as follows&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checkout the DryDrop repository from github&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deploy your drydrop app to app engine (&lt;em&gt;rake upload project=drydropsample&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a git repository on github&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place static content in the github repository&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Link the two (&lt;em&gt;add the github repo raw url in the drydrop admin settings&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visit app engine app url (&lt;em&gt;this pulls the static content from github and caches it&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BAM&lt;/strong&gt; you have a site hosted on google&#39;s infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Super easy and convenient. The best part is that this is free if your static site doesn&#39;t use more resources than the free tier of app engine allows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used this and my mind was blown. However, there were a couple of things missing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Hosting multiple domains on one instance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I played with drydrop extensively and launched a few sites, I noticed a hole in the drydrop armor. For every site you launched, you had to deploy a version of the drydrop container to app engine. Although they were all free, most people only have 10 application slots, and it was a pain to manage. I needed a way to host multiple sites on one instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought about this for about 2 seconds before I remembered solving this problem with some other python apps hosted on App Engine. I needed to key the datastore off of the domain (now-a-days you could use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/multitenancy/&quot;&gt;multitenacy stuff&lt;/a&gt; and just set the app namespace to change for each served domain (this might be a good idea to migrate drydrop too - i will do that later)).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made the change on my fork and deployed it to GAE. Then did a bunch of tests to make sure it worked properly. It did and the code was pulled into the main drydrop repo. Excitement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you can deploy one drydrop app and host many many domains off a single app instance. I currently host about 15 domains off of one drydrop instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Free Hosting, FTW&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s review what we have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Free hosting for multiple domains consisting of static content on a google scale infrastructure. For free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is awesome. and once you have it set up, there are only two steps to getting another site hosted (1. register domain, 2. point to drydrop instance). I launch stupid sites constantly now. It is an addiction. I need help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pro-Tips&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have used this setup for about 6 months. It works super well. I noticed that things loaded super fast all over the world, which is pretty awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have done 3 things to make things faster: use a CDN, use the high performance replication scheme, and use always on instances to decrease startup time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will attempt to cover each of these quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Use a CDN&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/&quot;&gt;Amazon Cloudfront&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2010/11/amazon-cloudfront-support-for-custom-origins.html&quot;&gt;custom origin&lt;/a&gt;. This is simply a way to take advantage of using a cdn without having to uplaod my data and assets to s3 first. I have &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/780318&quot;&gt;two scripts that I use to manage this process&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/780318#file_create_custom_origin.py&quot;&gt;first sets up the origin server&lt;/a&gt; with cloudfront, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/780318#file_invalidate_cf_cdn.py&quot;&gt;second clears my cached items&lt;/a&gt; when I need to deploy a change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How this works is simple. I cname &lt;a href=&quot;http://media.nata2.org/images/AStrangeYouCanBelieveIn.png&quot;&gt;media.nata2.org&lt;/a&gt; to cloudfront. Then every request to that domain goes to cloudfront. Cloudfront checks if the asset exists on itself, if it doesn&#39;t it goes and fetches it from the pre set origin server (in this case www.nata2.org) and then serves it. All subsequent requests are served directly off of the CDN. No more scripts to upload shit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is the only civilized way to use a CDN. I hope that Akamai/Rackspace rolls this out in the future. I prefer Akamai&#39;s network to Amazons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Use the High Performance Replication Datastore on App Engine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very recently Google released a neat addition to the App Engine world: &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/datastore/hr/overview.html&quot;&gt;High Replication Datastore&lt;/a&gt;. From the google app engine post:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The High Replication Datastore provides the highest level of availability for your reads and writes, at the cost of increased latency for writes and changes in consistency guarantees in the API.
The High Replication Datastore increases the number of data centers that maintain replicas of your data by using the Paxos algorithm to synchronize that data across datacenters in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BOO YEA!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes your simple static no write app engine app bullet proof (it seems). If there is a data store outage - this should keep your app up and running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downside is that it is about twice as expensive to host. There is a chance that it will still be free for a static site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have played with this less, but have deployed it to my blog and we shall see soon if it works well or costs me an arm and a leg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Set the app to be &quot;Always On&quot;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another recent feature added to App Engine is the ability to keep an &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/adminconsole/instances.html#Always_On&quot;&gt;instance of your app &quot;on&quot;&lt;/a&gt;. This should decrease startup times for stale apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, when I visit one of these sites that don&#39;t get a lot of traffic there is a small pause while the app starts up. With an Always On instance, this should stop happening. App Engine keeps an instance of your application warm and ready to server for a measly $0.30 per day ($9.00 per month). A pretty sweet deal if your site suddenly not performing worries you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have only played around with this - and haven&#39;t deployed it to my blog or in production sites. I also don&#39;t notice a huge problem with sites not serving quickly enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Awesome&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last two tips are app wide - which means that they will work for all sites that are deployed on that instance of DryDrop. You will be able to split the costs associated with the high performance replication and the ALways On instances across the number of domains you are hosting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes me LOVE hosting again.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>2010 Retrospective</title>
   <link href="http://www.nata2.org/2011/01/01/2010-retrospective/"/>
   <updated>2011-01-01T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.nata2.org/2011/01/01/2010-retrospective</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;2010 was a great year. I rarely write these retrospectives (only &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nata2.org/2009/01/04/2008-retrospectiv/&quot;&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt; I think), but i think about writing them every year. It is so cheesey, but also a fun exercise in memory and retrospection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So.. here goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2010 was a great year. I spent a bunch of time helping startups, hanging out with friends, spending time with Hiromi, traveling and enjoying life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Work&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent most of 2010 doing my best to avoid deliverables and enjoy not having a day to day job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started out 2010 in San Antonio, TX hanging out with my friends at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rackspace.com/&quot;&gt;Rackspace&lt;/a&gt;. Rackspace is an awesome company and is powered by a great group of people. They are doing some neat stuff and are fighting a good fight. I am excited to see some of the stuff we talked about come to fruition. The coolest of those things is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openstack.org/&quot;&gt;Open Stack&lt;/a&gt; taking off. This changed everything in the cloud world. I finished my Rackspace gig in April. It was a great opportunity and hilarious to hang out in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zdnet.com/blog/green/rackspace-offers-a-unique-green-way-to-recycle-an-abandoned-mall/768&quot;&gt;mall&lt;/a&gt;. I was also excited to have Rackspace &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudkick.com/acquisition-faq&quot;&gt;acquire&lt;/a&gt; my friends at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudkick.com/&quot;&gt;Cloudkick&lt;/a&gt;. That was a great move. Congratulations to everyone involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Rackspace gig was over, I had nothing else planned. It allowed me to jump into my next plan. Learning about Startups, Venture Capital and the business of business. &lt;strong&gt;;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Startups&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2010 also allowed me to further my interest in venture capital and startup funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a lot of time with &lt;a href=&quot;https://sandboxindustries.com/&quot;&gt;Sandbox Industries&lt;/a&gt;. They have a bunch of neat things going on and are succeeding in helping change the Chicago startup landscape. I am excited to see what 2011 brings fro &lt;a href=&quot;http://bookyap.com/&quot;&gt;Bookyap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://lab42.com/&quot;&gt;Lab 42&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marblesthebrainstore.com/&quot;&gt;Marbles: the Brain Store&lt;/a&gt; and the other Sandbox startups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also had a chance to hang out with my friends at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dfjmercury.com/&quot;&gt;DFJ Mercury&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dfjmercury.com/blair-garrou/&quot;&gt;Blair&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dfjmercury.com/aziz-ahmed-gilani/&quot;&gt;Aziz&lt;/a&gt; are awesome. I also am super excited about my friends and DFJ portfolio companies &lt;a href=&quot;http://infochimps.com/&quot;&gt;Infochimps&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://graphic.ly/&quot;&gt;Graphicly&lt;/a&gt;. 2011 is going to be awesome for them. I can&#39;t wait to see this crew at SXSW 2011. It should be insane and fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Startup funding has changed quite a bit in 2010. I was lucky to be at the forefront of this change by being a Angel List scout. You can learn more about it on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nata2.org/2010/09/03/yes-i-am-a-venture-hacks-scout/&quot;&gt;scout blog post&lt;/a&gt;. Interacting with Naval and Nivi has been awesome. They are great dudes who are changing the face of startup funding whether the industry wants it or not.  It will be neat to see how 2011 turns out with early stage funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot wait for Chicago to see the funding impact of Groupon&#39;s success. It is really exciting to see my friends achieve so much and I am very excited for how this impacts Chicago in the next 5 years. My buddy &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/leonc&quot;&gt;Leon Chism&lt;/a&gt; wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://leonc.tumblr.com/post/2071971732/chicago-mafias&quot;&gt;post on this topic awhile ago, I suggest you read it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of startups in Chicago, 2010 was a record year for startup culture and execution for us Chicagoans. We saw the rise of Groupon, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/group/hn-chicago&quot;&gt;Chicago hacker news meetups&lt;/a&gt; and a few &lt;a href=&quot;http://startupmixology.techcocktail.com/2010-chicago/&quot;&gt;good conferences&lt;/a&gt;. I am super exctied to see what this Chicago startup community achieves in 2011. Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Technology&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2010 I launched a few neat applications. I soft launched &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ctaalerts.com/&quot;&gt;CTA Alerts&lt;/a&gt; with Dan X. O&#39;Neil - a aggregation of various alerts in the Chicago Transit system (with the coolest URL shortener - &lt;a href=&quot;http://trn.st&quot;&gt;trn.st&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I launched &lt;a href=&quot;http://supertrackr.com&quot;&gt;Supertracker&lt;/a&gt; - a really neat &quot;track everything&quot; via xmpp site powered by my friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/julien51&quot;&gt;Julien&#39;s&lt;/a&gt; startup &lt;a href=&quot;http://superfeedr.com&quot;&gt;Superfeedr.com&lt;/a&gt;. SuperTrackr got a bunch of writeups and was doing crazy incoming &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/&quot;&gt;PuSH&lt;/a&gt; traffic. All scaled magically by App Engine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also launched the hilarious &lt;a href=&quot;http://ProximityCheckin.com&quot;&gt;ProximityCheckin.com&lt;/a&gt; - a site that merges your Google Latitude location with foursquare checkins. Originally I wanted it to be automagic - but that is complicated. I am still experimenting with it and should have some progress shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the above applications were weekend projects built on &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/appengine/&quot;&gt;App Engine&lt;/a&gt;. I enjoy App Engine and can&#39;t wait to see what is next for that platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2010 I also got addicted to personal informatics. I got a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002JE2PSA?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=nata2productions&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B002JE2PSA&quot;&gt;withings scale&lt;/a&gt; and a fitbit and started tracking all sorts of things manically. I &lt;a href=&quot;http://harperreed.org/informatics&quot;&gt;hooked it into my personal site&lt;/a&gt; and made &lt;a href=&quot;http://harperreed.org/informatics/steps/&quot;&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://harperreed.org/informatics/weight/&quot;&gt;graphs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also started tracking my location as well. You can see &lt;a href=&quot;http://harperreed.org/where&quot;&gt;up-to-date location infomation on my personal site as well&lt;/a&gt;. Including a &lt;a href=&quot;http://harperreed.org/where/now&quot;&gt;relatively accurate real time display of my location&lt;/a&gt;. I love Google latitude and am excited for all the things that can be powered by constantly updating location information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also scored a really neat award based on the work my buddy Dan X O&#39;neil and I did on the CTA api. You can check out my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nata2.org/2010/09/25/cta-hacking-unofficial-apis-and-winning-a-data-innovation-award/&quot;&gt;write-up&lt;/a&gt; to learn more. I love the civic hacking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2011 is going to be an amazing year for technology. My simple &quot;2 word&quot; predictions are: Cheap Android, More Javascript, Kindle Epub, more Nodejs, auto scaling, app engine, and minor AI. I am excited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Personal&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2010 we moved from lincoln square to wicker park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hung out in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/sets/72157625598388247/&quot;&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; for a bunch of time and we spent  a bunch of time in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeley,_Colorado&quot;&gt;Greeley, CO&lt;/a&gt;. It was nice to spend some quality time with Hiromi&#39;s family and my family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&quot;http://dylanreed.com&quot;&gt;brother&lt;/a&gt; and I played &lt;a href=&quot;http://minecraft.net/&quot;&gt;Minecraft&lt;/a&gt; a bunch. It was a bit like when we played legos as kids. However, I was better sharing the pieces with Minecraft. &lt;a href=&quot;http://harperreed.org/minecraft/&quot;&gt;Here is a map of our world&lt;/a&gt; as of 01/01/2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the best parts of 2010 was hanging out with my amazing wife Hiromi. She is awesome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a great year and was awesome. Things were low key and everything was wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Some 2010 statistics&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some stats on various things in 2010:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Social&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Twitter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I tweeted an average of &lt;strong&gt;12 times a day&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most tweets I tweeted was &lt;strong&gt;52&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://harperreed.org/activity?date=2010-01-10&quot;&gt;January 10th&lt;/a&gt;. This was one of my first days hanging out at Rackspace. Apparently I was enjoying hanging out with all my friends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Foursquare&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I checked into an average of &lt;strong&gt;2 places a day&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most checkins in a single day was &lt;strong&gt;9&lt;/strong&gt; checkins on &lt;a href=&quot;http://harperreed.org/activity?date=2010-03-14&quot;&gt;March 14th&lt;/a&gt; during the checkin frenzy that is SXSW.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Flickr Photos&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I uploaded an average of &lt;strong&gt;1 photo per day&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most photos I uploaded in a single day was on &lt;a href=&quot;http://harperreed.org/activity?date=2010-07-20&quot;&gt;July 20th&lt;/a&gt; when I scanned and uploaded &lt;strong&gt;100&lt;/strong&gt; of my ticket stubs. Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/sets/72157624542393586/&quot;&gt;set&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Google Reader Shares&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I shared an average of &lt;strong&gt;10 shares a day&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most shares in a single day was &lt;strong&gt;50 shares&lt;/strong&gt; on [January 7th]. It was my first day in San Antonio and I apparently was waiting to go into the office.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Health&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I tracked my weight &lt;strong&gt;263 days&lt;/strong&gt; and my steps &lt;strong&gt;142 days&lt;/strong&gt;. I wasn&#39;t very good at tracking my sleep, I only tracked &lt;strong&gt;65 nights&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sleep&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Of the nights tracked, I slept an average of &lt;strong&gt;7.1 hours&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My average bedtime was &lt;strong&gt;2:18 am&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Steps&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On average I do an average of &lt;strong&gt;7197 steps a day&lt;/strong&gt;. That is about &lt;strong&gt;3.4 miles per day&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was a gigantic slacker on &lt;a href=&quot;http://harperreed.org/activity?date=2010-07-28&quot;&gt;July 28th&lt;/a&gt; and only took &lt;strong&gt;203 steps&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On &lt;a href=&quot;http://harperreed.org/activity?date=2010-08-9&quot;&gt;August 9th&lt;/a&gt; I did about &lt;strong&gt;21423 steps&lt;/strong&gt;. I was at a lollapalooza afterparty and dancing my ass off. It was awesome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Weight&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My weight in 2010 was hilarious. It was all over the place. Check out this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/5232405147/&quot;&gt;graph&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I started out at about &lt;strong&gt;178 lbs&lt;/strong&gt; in the beginning of 2010.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On &lt;a href=&quot;http://harperreed.org/activity?date=2010-06-6&quot;&gt;June 6th&lt;/a&gt; I was the heaviest I was in 2010 at &lt;strong&gt;180 lbs&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My goal was &lt;strong&gt;170 lbs&lt;/strong&gt; and I achieved that around October 2010. On &lt;a href=&quot;http://harperreed.org/activity?date=2010-10-29&quot;&gt;October 29th&lt;/a&gt; I weighed in at &lt;strong&gt;166.9 lbs&lt;/strong&gt;, the least I weighed during 2010.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I currently weight &lt;strong&gt;172.5 lbs&lt;/strong&gt; and I blame the holidays and candy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Travel&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I traveled more in 2010 than I have any year previous. I was out of Chicago around &lt;strong&gt;88 days&lt;/strong&gt;. That is about &lt;strong&gt;23.84% of the year&lt;/strong&gt; away from home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Of the &lt;strong&gt;87 days&lt;/strong&gt;, I spent &lt;strong&gt;68 days&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;18.63% of the year&lt;/strong&gt;) traveling in the US and &lt;strong&gt;20 days&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;5.48% of the year&lt;/strong&gt;) traveling internationally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Within the &lt;strong&gt;68 days&lt;/strong&gt; spent traveling in the United States I spent time in the following states: California (&lt;strong&gt;4.66% of the year&lt;/strong&gt;), Texas (&lt;strong&gt;7.40%&lt;/strong&gt;), Colorado (&lt;strong&gt;5.48%&lt;/strong&gt;), Massachusetts (&lt;strong&gt;0.82%&lt;/strong&gt;) and New Mexico (&lt;strong&gt;0.27%&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I spent &lt;strong&gt;20 days&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;5.48% of the year&lt;/strong&gt;) in Japan. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/sets/72157625598388247/&quot;&gt;It was amazing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h1&gt;2011 is going to be awesome&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am very excited for everything that 2011 is going to bring. I have a lot of plans. Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Lincoln Square Retrospective</title>
   <link href="http://www.nata2.org/2010/12/07/lincoln-square-retrospective/"/>
   <updated>2010-12-07T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.nata2.org/2010/12/07/lincoln-square-retrospective</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I meant to post this months ago. hah. For some reason, it didn&#39;t quite make it live. Then a couple days ago, I was talking to a friend about his recent move to Lincoln Square. We spent some time talking about great places to go eat and hang out, and I remembered this post. I thought I would get it up and out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple months ago, Hiromi and I moved from Lincoln Square to Wicker Park. We had wanted to live in Wicker Park for many years and since we have nothing keeping us in Lincoln Square - we decided to go ahead and move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lincoln Square was awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed living there for the 3 years we were there. The neighborhood was awesome. The people were great. The nightlife was... well, there was a bunch of great restaurants. ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to take a minute to chronicle the places we went to a bunch and the places we liked. Hopefully this list will helpful to someone. These are all the places I will miss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jurysrestaurant.com/&quot;&gt;Jury’s&lt;/a&gt; - This place is insane. It has great hamburgers, great food and great service. It also has one of the strangest crowds in Lincoln Square. Always makes me chuckle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.drewseatery.com/&quot;&gt;Drew’s Eatery&lt;/a&gt; - I like drew. He is nice. His eatery is a great place to get an afternoon snack or quick dinner. Very vegan friendly. This is key. They have Italian beef sandwiches. It isn’t often you can go to a vegan friendly place and order an Italian beef sandwich. I enjoy their water in a box.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theglobepub.com/&quot;&gt;The Globe&lt;/a&gt; - I think i went here 500 times for lunch with the SkinnyTech crew. It is a good place to watch people, football, rugby or have cheese fries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cafe28.org/&quot;&gt;Cafe28&lt;/a&gt; - I love cafe 28. I suggest you go there immediately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adeliciousvegancafe.com/&quot;&gt;Delicious Cafe&lt;/a&gt; - another vegan friendly place in the area. They have great vegan sandwiches and sweets. They often host dinners and other special vegan events.
*&lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.google.com/places/us/il/chicago/w-leland-ave/2308/-rosded-restaurant?gl=us&quot;&gt;Rosded&lt;/a&gt; - This is my favorite Thai place. It is cheap, good and small - as all thai places should be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.costellosandwich.com/&quot;&gt;Costellos&lt;/a&gt; - makes good sandwiches. We often walked there on an afternoon. It is always packed with families.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.halfacrebeer.com/&quot;&gt;Half Acre Brewery&lt;/a&gt; - a recent addition to the neighborhood. It is a great way to grab a growler for a party or BYOB place.
*&lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.google.com/places/us/il/chicago/w-montrose-ave/2030/-mythos-restaurant?hl=en&amp;amp;gl=us&quot;&gt;Mythos&lt;/a&gt; - Mythos is insane. I love every bit of it. If you are a fan of Greek foods and like BYOB then this place is for you. Mix it with some wine or the aforementioned Half Acre growler.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.glennsdiner.com/&quot;&gt;Glenn’s&lt;/a&gt; - I think this is one of my favorite places in Lincoln Square. It is hilariously packed. Make a reservation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.merzapothecary.com/&quot;&gt;Mertz&lt;/a&gt; - this is for hiromi and hippies. They have nice soap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://store.hazelchicago.com/&quot;&gt;Hazel&lt;/a&gt; - A nice gift store/nick nack store. A great place for picking up gifts or party favors. I recommend it. We got many good items here. The people are always nice and they do gift wrapping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.firstslice.org/&quot;&gt;First Slice cafe&lt;/a&gt; - another great lunch spot. Out of the way. tasty and nice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://chosunokrestaurant.com/&quot;&gt;Cho Sun Ok&lt;/a&gt; - The insane people who went here took ALL of our parking spots, always. But for good reason. this is a great korean place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/movies?hl=en&amp;amp;near=Chicago&amp;amp;dq=davis+theatre&amp;amp;theater=davis&quot;&gt;Davis Theatre&lt;/a&gt; - It is like a grindhouse theatre mixed with yuppies. A great place to see a cheap movie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I imagine I missed a bunch of great places. If you have any favs, leave them in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really like Lincoln Square. I think we would live there again.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Tech Cocktail Startup Mixology Conference</title>

   <id>http://www.nata2.org/2010/11/01/techcocktail-mixology-conference</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On October 28th, I had the pleasure of speaking at the Tech Cocktail Startup Mixology Conference. It was a fun quick conference with a set of amazing speakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is my talk. I spoke about fostering a community of problem solvers. Here are my &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/present/view?id=dd3wvxq5_649fzcvqpvz&amp;amp;interval=5&amp;amp;autoStart=true&quot;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/object&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Would love to know your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am excited to see Tech Cocktail grow. I have been going to TC for years now. Threadless sponsored the first TC in boulder, we had tables at various TC&#39;s in Chicago. Scott and I did a really amazing presentation on printers at the first TC conference. It has been awesome. I can&#39;t wait to see what Frank has in store for TC next.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>CTA Hacking, Unofficial APIs and Winning a Data Innovation Award</title>
   <link href="http://www.nata2.org/2010/09/25/cta-hacking-unofficial-apis-and-winning-a-data-innovation-award/"/>
   <updated>2010-09-25T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.nata2.org/2010/09/25/cta-hacking-unofficial-apis-and-winning-a-data-innovation-award</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/juggernautco/2913444222/in/photostream/&quot;&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3250/2913444222_5f01a20397_m.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Back in 2008 I hacked an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nata2.org/2008/10/06/chicago-transit-api/&quot;&gt;unofficial api&lt;/a&gt; together from the exposed endpoints of the CTA’s bustracker application. This spawned a bunch of CTA applications in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2009/04/iphone-app-showdown-battle-of-the-cta-bus-trackers.ars&quot;&gt;iOS app store&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?q=chicago+transit+authority+android&quot;&gt;android app store&lt;/a&gt; and created a really neat &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.transitchicago.com/apps/&quot;&gt;ecosystem&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/transitapi&quot;&gt;CTA hackers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For awhile, nobody but us transit nerds paid attention to this api/hack. However, as more and more apps were built and more and more people used those apps - more people started noticing the benefits from the opening of this “api.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The API got a number of really good write-ups, particularly about how the API was unofficial and how I went around hacking it. The first (and best) was by my good friend Dan X. O’neil: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.derivativeworks.com/2009/01/h.html&quot;&gt;&quot;The power is not the mashup. It&#39;s the data.&quot;&lt;/a&gt;. From here a bunch of really great posts popped up talking about the unofficial API and innovation. Joe Hughes blogged about whether the unofficial API is &lt;a href=&quot;http://headwayblog.com/2008/12/14/unofficial-cta-apis/&quot;&gt;innovation on borrowed time&lt;/a&gt;. Programmable Web &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.programmableweb.com/2009/01/27/hacking-chicagos-unofficial-transit-api/&quot;&gt;summarized Dan’s piece and added some commentary&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the aforementioned post by Dan O&#39;Neil, He talks about how we visited the CTA and chatted with them about the API. In the world of litigious organizations and scary governments - working with the CTA was awesome. They listened to what I did, asked really solid questions and then told us some of their plans. A lot of what we talked about ended up being included in their official API release. Dan’s brother Kevin O’Neil wrote this relationship and the results up on the CTA Tattler blog: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chicagonow.com/blogs/cta-tattler/2010/09/great-example-of-government-private-cooperation-harper-reed-wins-an-inaugural-mcic-data-innovation-award-for-chicago-transit-api.html&quot;&gt;Great example of government-private cooperation: Harper Reed wins award for CTA&#39;s Bus Tracker API&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interacting with the CTA directly and working with them on their app was great. It really demonstrates how a private citizen can affect the mega government type organization to make things better for the future. I don’t think this is an easy pattern to replicate - but it is something to aspire to when hacking/proselytizing open data and open gov type APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/5014492675/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4144/5014492675_5a23a61f3a_m.jpg&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; width=&quot;200&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
The most recent chapter in this story is that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.mcic.org/2010/09/mcic-project-prize-takes-a-turn/&quot;&gt;MCIC awarded me a Data Innovation Award&lt;/a&gt;. I was sadly unable to participate in the award ceremony(I was drinking Chu-Hi in tokyo), but I hear it was awesome. Dan O’Neil was able to pick my award and say some words about what we did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people helped make this happen. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.derivativeworks.com/&quot;&gt;Dan O’Neil&lt;/a&gt; was an inspiration and really helped me figure out a strategy in working with the CTA. The CTA itself was awesome - especially &lt;a href=&quot;http://coppoletta.net/&quot;&gt;Tony Coppoletta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chicago-l.org/&quot;&gt;Graham Garfield&lt;/a&gt;. Both of those dudes made it easy to work with the CTA and are also sweet guys outside of the CTA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been a really good hack. ;) I am now a data innovator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a startup that you want to submit to the angellist, you can do so yourself by &lt;a href=&quot;http://angel.co/intro&quot;&gt;submitting directly to the angel list&lt;/a&gt;. If you want more information about the angel list, or would like me to take a look at your startup (and get all the perks of interacting with a person as amazing as myself - hah) - then send an &lt;a href=&quot;http://harperreed.org/contact&quot;&gt;email to me directly&lt;/a&gt;. I am pretty easy to contact and can help out in many ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am looking to help out and interact with midwest startups. I am very serious about making sure that Chicago continues to be a good place to be an entrepreneur. Having venturehack/angel list representation in Chicago will continue to help the community. Be sure an check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://angel.co/chicago&quot;&gt;listing for Chicago Angels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making the Midwest/Chicago a great place for starting a company isn’t just for people like myself, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lightbank.com&quot;&gt;groupon guys&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sandboxindustries.com&quot;&gt;sandbox&lt;/a&gt; and the angels. It is about the entrepreneur as well. Please let me know if you have ideas, concerns or just general insights into making the Midwest/Chicago the best place to start a company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are outside of the Chicago/Midwest area - feel free to ping me anyway. I am always looking for new startups to talk to and people to connect.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>I migrated this blog to Jekyll on App Engine. So long Wordpress. </title>
   <link href="http://www.nata2.org/2010/08/17/jekyl-for-the-win/"/>
   <updated>2010-08-17T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.nata2.org/2010/08/17/jekyl-for-the-win</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t like to move my blog around. It is super annoying. The RSS feed gets all messed up, I spend months tweaking everything. I find silly bugs and then fascinate about fixing them. All in all it takes months to complete the process. I avoid it like the plague.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I really wanted something simpler than wordpress. I didn’t need a CMS. I barely need a blogging engine. I update so infrequently. I want something that creates well formed html (hah), static content and is easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started looking into hosting this blog on Google’s app engine awhile ago. I looked into &lt;a href=&quot;http://bloog.billkatz.com/&quot; title=&quot;Bloog&quot;&gt;Bloog&lt;/a&gt; - an awesome restful bloggin engine for app engine. It was very hopeful. i spent a bunch of time hacking on it and eventually ported my theme over. I didn’t feel it though. it worked well. it had all the features i wanted. It even used a bunch of neat app engine tricks. I gave up on using it for my blog. It just wasn’t the correct choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this time, I watched most of my hackerish friends start to use Jekyll to power their blogs (or write and then use &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/aconbere/igor&quot; title=&quot;igor&quot;&gt;igor&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=&quot;http://anders.conbere.org/&quot;&gt;anders&lt;/a&gt; did (protip: do not search for “anders jekyll” in google)). I admired the simplicity of the jekyll engine. It was so easy and fun to use. I wanted to use it for my blog - but it didn’t play as nicely with app engine as i had hoped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then found Drydrop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DryDrop is a neat application for app engine that let’s you host static content. In my current phase of life, I really hate managing servers. It is fun and all - but if i don’t have to - i am not going to. ;) Instead, I try and use platform as a service services(&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAS_syndrome&quot;&gt;heh&lt;/a&gt;) to minimize the number of servers that I touch on a daily basis (my current server number is 4 (I secretly want it to grow back to 100+)). DryDrop was a nice solution for my server hatred. It allowed me to serve simple static content on app engine. I immediately ported a bunch of my static sites over to app engine: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.harpercloud.com/&quot;&gt;harpercloud.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.biofuelmenace.com/&quot;&gt;biofuelmenace.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://weownthesun.com&quot;&gt;weownthesun.com&lt;/a&gt; and of course &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ryankanno.com&quot;&gt;ryankanno.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few weeks with these sites on app engine - I decided that it was probably the right place to put my precious blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; is an interesting beast. It is exactly as the wiki proclaims: &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll/&quot;&gt;a simple, blog aware, static site generator&lt;/a&gt;. It has no features (well. a couple), it has no built in community aspects (no commenting, trackbacks, reactions, etc). It doesn’t have any admin. it is just a static site generator that is geared for blog like sites. It works amazingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I did was port my theme over to Jekyll. You can check this out at my &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/harperreed/harperreed-blog&quot;&gt;blogs git repository&lt;/a&gt;. It was a pain in the ass, but i was able to clean up a bunch of annoying HTML issues that i had from changing shit all the time. I still need to refactor it a bunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the theme was done, I started working on the content. This is the biggest issue. I have a bunch of content. Like 1000s of posts. Jekyll is not necessarily the quickest of generators when you have thousands of posts. Luckily I was able to do some simple tricks to ensure that the old posts work and the new posts work as well. Its honestly pretty annoying and i need to solve this better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple hints for hosting Jekyll on App Engine with DryDrop:
* check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://thelab.carlsverre.com/2010/02/09/static-hosting&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.carlsverre.com/&quot;&gt;Carl Sverre&lt;/a&gt; on tweaking the site.yaml file for drydrop to handle the pretty permalinks
* the wordpress migration script that jekyll uses is pretty nice. i &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/harperreed/harperreed-blog/blob/master/_import/wordpress.rb&quot;&gt;hacked mine to export tags and datetime&lt;/a&gt; as well.
* there are hundreds of blog posts just like this one. they all have great hints
* if you get stuck, just check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll/sites&quot;&gt;list of sites that are using jekyll&lt;/a&gt;. Often they have source on github. you can glean all sorts of goodness from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is a bummer to leave wordpress. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been on wordpress since early 2005. I think that is the longest I have stayed with 1 piece of software. I really enjoy the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/support/&quot;&gt;wordpress community&lt;/a&gt;. I really like &lt;a href=&quot;http://ma.tt/&quot;&gt;matt&lt;/a&gt; and all he has done for open source and the internet. I like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://drewblas.com/2010/07/15/an-analysis-of-gpled-code-in-thesis/&quot;&gt;fights they pick&lt;/a&gt; and i enjoy the &lt;a href=&quot;http://buddypress.org/&quot;&gt;innovations they are bringing to blogging&lt;/a&gt;. I don’t like having to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?q=wordpress+exploit&quot;&gt;fight hackers&lt;/a&gt; off every single day. If there was one reason i am abandoning wordpress it is because of the hackers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hosted about 25 wordpress blogs on my mosso account for various friends. I kept most of them up to date, but a lot of them were for friends and were not under my control. 100% of them got owned. hah. It was just something they did. no matter how fast or often i updated the wordpress software - it would be owned at least one time. My personal blog was safe for some reason. Maybe it was because I always ran the bleeding edge version from SVN. I will not miss the constant updates and the attacks.  The wordpress community does a good job of handling this issue. I, however, was tired of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I migrated at least 22 of the 25 hosted blogs to &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.com&quot;&gt;wordpress.com&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://posterous.com&quot;&gt;posterous&lt;/a&gt;. I killed all the unused wordpress installs. No more hackers getting in through plugins, themes or trickery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If i were to use wordpress again, I would either use &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.com&quot;&gt;wordpress.com&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://vaultpress.com/&quot;&gt;vaultpress&lt;/a&gt;. Both of those products seem to solve my problems. Right now, however, jekyll has pretty thoroughly solved them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t wait to start updating this blog a bit more often. I don’t know if i will write like i did in &lt;a href=&quot;/2003/&quot;&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&quot;/2004/&quot;&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt; - but i plan to update it a bit more than i did in &lt;a href=&quot;/2009/&quot;&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;. We shall see ;)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Smitten by the iPad: thoughts and complaints. </title>
   <link href="http://www.nata2.org/2010/04/05/smitten-by-the-ipad-thoughts-and-complaints/"/>
   <updated>2010-04-05T05:14:42Z</updated>
   <id>http://www.nata2.org/2010/04/05/smitten-by-the-ipad-thoughts-and-complaints</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;The ipad is awesome by nata2, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/4488064118/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4052/4488064118_ea9d770433_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The ipad is awesome&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I was tricked by the gravitational forces that an apple product announcement causes into visiting the apple store. Five hundred bucks later I walked out of the apple store with a fancy new iPad. Excited and Doh!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iPad is a new and very exciting paradigm for computing. I played with it afternoon and it felt very minority report. It felt like the future. no physical keyboard. I was controlling things with my finger/mind. it was awesome. I am smitten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the irrational distortion field emitted by this shiny device, I have some general thoughts/complaints on the iPad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The lack of camera is irrational.&lt;/strong&gt; I have no idea why apple didn&#39;t include two cameras on the iPad. It would be an amazing device for parents, students, people, etc. Chatting is annoying on non-multitasking devices, however it might be nice to Skype with a slate like device. It will obviously be added to the next iteration of this device.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The iWork cloud platform is annoying.&lt;/strong&gt; Importing and exporting documents is very hard. It is obviously not meant to be used by people who have documents already. The only way to get shit on the device is to download it. Why wouldn&#39;t Apple integrate iWork with MobileMe? silly. Google will have to change their Docs platform to allow easy downloading from the mobile google docs page.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The lack of any clock or alarm app very strange.&lt;/strong&gt; I use the clock app on the iphone for a lot of stuff. not having that is a bummer. but in the grand scheme of bummers its about a 0.00001/5.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is no usb host mode&lt;/strong&gt; (that i know of). I would love to charge my phone, etc via USB with this device. it would minimize the number of cables and what not i would bring. It would also be awesome to plugin external disks or keyboards to it.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Reader blows on the iPad.&lt;/strong&gt; This is a real bummer since that is pretty much the one thing i want to have all the time. You can&#39;t scroll with the desktop version and the mobile version seems silly on the iPad. I can&#39;t wait for Google to &quot;fix&quot; all of their webapps for the iPad.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using an iPhone after spending a lot of time on the iPad makes the iPhone seem like a midget&lt;/strong&gt;. It makes the nexus one seems like it is made out of paper.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The iPad is probably one of the coolest ways to show presentations to someone while sitting at a bar.&lt;/strong&gt; I have been pitching some ideas to people and having the iPad with my deck is pretty awesome. A great way to go over your presentation with one or two people. Way better than a laptop.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Kindle app is awesome&lt;/strong&gt;. I like it a lot. I want to try reading a book on the iPad, but i really like the kindle&#39;s screen.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most of the apps are boring.&lt;/strong&gt; Seriously. The apps that are impressive are: Kayak, Maps, Photos, Kindle, Twitterrific, instapaper, Netflix and Square&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://squareup.com/&quot;&gt;Square&lt;/a&gt; is one of the coolest apps I have seen.&lt;/strong&gt; It should blow peoples minds. I imagine that it will be a game changer for friends who do retail. I can&#39;t wait for my square card reader to show up. I will be charging my friends for everything.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is an amazing device for casual internet use.&lt;/strong&gt; I imagine that Hiromi, my parents, my brother and anyone else who isn&#39;t attached to a computer all day long would love these devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Overall the iPad is amazing. I can&#39;t wait to see how developers iterate on the platform and create really nifty applications. It will also be fun to see what features Apple magically unlocks on the iPad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am going to try and build some applications now. If you have ideas - let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Musings about femtocells: the futures!</title>
   <link href="http://www.nata2.org/2010/02/11/musings-about-femtocells-the-futures/"/>
   <updated>2010-02-11T07:44:15Z</updated>
   <id>http://www.nata2.org/2010/02/11/musings-about-femtocells-the-futures</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;I wrote most of this entry the day before the earthquake in Haiti. It was motivated by the magicJack announcement and my interest in mobile devices within developing nations.  However, the thoughts in this post suddenly seemed more real after I started hearing reports of communication breakdown after the earthquake.&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The femtocell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the recent CES, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MagicJack&quot;&gt;magicJack company&lt;/a&gt; announced that they wanted to release a consumer grade FemtoCell device as an upgrade to their USB FXO/Softphone device.  Note: magicJack is an insane company. You probably have seen them on television commercials while watching USA &#39;Up All Night&#39;.  While these commercials almost seem scam-like, they have apparently sold 5 million USB magicJacks.  That&#39;s a lot of phone calls!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A femtocell device is basically a mini GSM/CDMA tower. Think of it as a wi-fi AP but instead of wi-fi - it is GSM. You could drop it into your house, plug it into the Internet, and suddenly get 5 bars of connectivity on your mobile handset - instead of the standard AT&amp;amp;T 1 bar. magicJack is offering the same service the USB dongle provides (unlimited calling and what not), but for mobile phones.  As a consumer, you would need to configure your handset to use the magicJack femtocell to receive/send calls.  When you are in range of the device (w/ signal strength enough to cover ~3000 sq. ft. house), you would bypass your carrier and use the magicJack for all incoming and outgoing calls. AWESOME.  Especially with the likes of Google Voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are questions on the legality of such a device - but it is apparently legal to use inside your residence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Side note: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?q=magicjack+sip&quot;&gt;Magicjack is SIP&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;a href=&quot;http://magicjackhacks.com/&quot;&gt;hackable&lt;/a&gt;. There is a cat and mouse game being played out trying to unlock it.  You can even use it with &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk_(PBX)&quot;&gt;Asterisk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The thoughts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I began to think.  Femtocells could be used to open up mobile VOIP.  One scenario is that you could jump on a 3rd party carrier for a limited time to make a p2p VOIP call using your current GSM/WCDMA mobile device.  That is really awesome.  More importantly, what&#39;s REALLY awesome is the pirate (3rd party) carriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine purchasing 100 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nata2.org/2010/01/17/i-love-phones-designed-for-developing-countries/&quot;&gt;Motorola F3&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnu_radio&quot;&gt;GNU Radio USRP2&lt;/a&gt; (~$1400) running the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenBTS&quot;&gt;OpenBTS stack&lt;/a&gt; and a super huge antenna - and suddenly becoming a rural/developing country mobile provider. Or - if you&#39;re more interested in being a pirate carrier - you could run this setup in a city and be a carrier for the dark side (drugs, gangs, nerds...). This inexpensive setup is available (and achievable) today!  In case of the apocalypse/disaster/camping/nerdcamp - I think it would be nice to have a set up to deploy to organize/help people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mind started to work into overtime.  I began thinking about the ramifications of hacking the magicJack. Wouldn&#39;t it be neat to use femtocell technology to distribute ad hoc mobile carriers around a neighborhood/disaster area/rural/developing country?  You could hook the magicJack femtocell up to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FON#Fonera_2.0n&quot;&gt;Fon2 device (usb/linux/broadband)&lt;/a&gt; and distribute them around in places with connectivity. All you would need is a better antenna and some software to manage the provisioning and device identification. BAM! Instant pirate P2P GSM carrier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am hoping that this type of convergence will lead us &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088763/&quot;&gt;to the future&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>I love phones designed for developing countries. </title>
   <link href="http://www.nata2.org/2010/01/18/i-love-phones-designed-for-developing-countries/"/>
   <updated>2010-01-18T01:49:55Z</updated>
   <id>http://www.nata2.org/2010/01/18/i-love-phones-designed-for-developing-countries</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Nokia 1100 and Motorola F3 by nata2, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/4283555038/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4039/4283555038_a798542c5f_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Nokia 1100 and Motorola F3&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;218&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love mobile phones. I don&#39;t know why - but mobile devices represent so much of what I love about technology. The ubiquity, the fascination, all the new technology that pops up and all the different way people use their devices. I also feel like mobile devices will be the future of whatever the internet turns out to be. They will power the internet. With all this in mind - I have started to become interested in the devices that fill the opposite niche. The devices that are SO simple that their are almost NO features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are not Razrs, or other shitty mobile devices which act like they have all sorts of amazing features.  These specific phones are single feature, cheap devices and are often deployed in developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two that I really enjoy and I suggest checking out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_1100&quot;&gt;Nokia 1100&lt;/a&gt;. Also known as my favorite phone in the world. I first saw this phone while working for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/sets/72057594078282161/&quot;&gt;a minute in Bangalore&lt;/a&gt;. It was advertised as a phone &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/india/article.cfm?articleid=4358&quot;&gt;made for india&lt;/a&gt;&quot; and apparently was hardy enough to be used by the working class there. I was drawn to the device. I neeeeeded it. It&#39;s weird, because at the time I was running a symbian device that supported about every possible feature available in mobile - so thinking about jumping to a mobile device that was pretty much featureless was crazy. But - I was compelled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The phone isn&#39;t that fancy. It has very few features. It is super tiny and is super cheap. It is just a basic, simple phone that does nothing more than look &quot;Nokia&quot; and probably makes calls. The features it has are incredibly handy: flashlight, alarm clock and sms messaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&#39;t realize it then, but the Nokia 1100 is possibly the most popular electronic device in the world. According to the infallible wikipedia: Nokia has sold ~200 million of the Nokia 1100s since it&#39;s launch in 2003. To put it in perspective - there have been ~30MM iPhones sold and ~50MM Razrs sold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I eventually got a couple of these and used them as lenders, experiments and generaly fucking around phones. I even sent one to my brother for him to use - which he eventually washed in a washing machine - it still boots. They are HARDY. and 20 bucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second phone that I am interested in is a bit newer and is  a bit more tech. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_FONE_F3&quot;&gt;Motorola F3&lt;/a&gt;. My buddy &lt;a href=&quot;http://thinkmoreinc.wordpress.com/2009/03/19/50-2/&quot;&gt;Hemmant showed it to me&lt;/a&gt;, told me a bit about the history and I couldn&#39;t stop thinking about it. Anecdotally, this phone was made by a Motorola team in india - again for use in the developing countries market. It is simple, has no features (even less than the 1100) and is JUST a phone. There is one major differentiator. The Motorola f3 is one of the only phones to have an e-ink display. This means that it uses very little power in standby (standby time of ~17 days), can be used in low light/no light situations and is rather resilient. The phone didn&#39;t sell as many as the Nokia 1100 - in fact it was a veritable failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The F3 has no features. It barely send txt messages. It has voice prompts for all menus. It is just a phone. A user serviceable, easy to charge, thin, e-ink phone. It works well making calls and receiving txt messages. The F3 would be an amazing phone for a child, elderly person or someone who doesn&#39;t want to deal with learning pesky features. I got one for my &quot;go bag&quot; as an emergency phone (I am not a survivalist, I just crush a lot).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find an unlocked &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013A7KMW?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=nata2productions&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B0013A7KMW&quot;&gt;Motorola f3 for about 30 bucks on amazon&lt;/a&gt;. I suggest you get one.&lt;/p&gt;
