<strong>Hi.</strong> I am an engineer who builds paradigm-shifting tech and leads others to do the same. I love using the enormity of the Internet to bring people together, whether as CTO of Obama for America, CTO at Threadless.com, or on my own projects. You can often find me playing with new technology, looking for something to hack, or enjoying life in Chicago with my amazing wife, Hiromi. Check out my <a href="http://harperreed.com">homepage</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=harper" target="_blank">follow me on twitter</a>.

    <p>i was playing around with my blog software and I noticed something pretty cool. I have taken over 1000 pictures with my nokia cell phone cam and have roughly 2525 pictures total in my photolog. I have taken pictures of a bunch of neat stuff. it is pretty cool. I have wanted to make a view that is the text from the blog and the pictures all in one fancy view. but I haven't. maybe soon. haha. <br/><br/>today I received my free ipod mini. wtf. so apparently it works. I really don't know what to do with it. I guess use it. I feel weird getting a free thing this expensive. but I guess shit like this happens all the time. heh. I also picked up the best invention in the world: the <a href="http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/081220042347/Nokia6600(029).jpg">tvB-gone</a>. basically it turns off all the tvs in its immediate view by sending out the commonly known IR off signals for north american tvs. it rules. all yesterday I was playing around at stores - turning off banks of tvs. it ruled. <br/><br/>i am attempting to pound out this site I am working on. it is kinda a pain. but whatever. I will finish er off. tonight is the first night I awhile I have been up past 1am. and I am not actually up past 1 yet. haha. I hope I don't screw this up. ;)<br/><br/><a href="http://www.nbc4i.com/news/3983630/detail.html">this</a> is absolutely insane. <blockquote><small>"Two members of the heavy metal band Damageplan were reportedly shot and killed, including Dimebag Darrell, formerly with the band Pantera, NBC 4's David Wayne reported. The other band member's name was not released. The alleged gunman also died at the scene, Wayne reported."</small></blockquote></p>

<p>woah. wtf. metal is getting out of hand. the people who listen to it are mentally unstable. it is absolutely true. <br/><br/>in other news - I saw cradle of filth last night. they sucked. well not sucked like were horrible - just not as good as <a href="http://www.the-gothicworld.de/cdreviews/09-2003/dimmu-borgir.jpg">dimmu borgir</a>. also - it appears that <a href="http://cof.rockmetal.art.pl/images/galeria/1.jpg">danny filth</a> has an unreasonably <a href="http://cof.rockmetal.art.pl/images/galeria/13.jpg">large head</a>. it was nuts. he runs out on stage - and I was like - wtf. and I laughed. and then lost interest. however I gained interest in a band called <a href="http://www.trustkill.com/multimedia/videos/bleeding_hail.html">bleeding through</a>. not really anything new. but good energy. and there is a pretty girl playing keyboard. haha. what a dumb metal guy thing to say. silly silly.
<br/><br/>i think I am going to get a <a href="http://www.stripper-faq.org/">new job</a>. oh wait I am not a hot girl. so I guess I am not going to. but if I become a hot girl. hells yea. speaking of hot ladies - lately I have been playing with OS X a lot. it rules. so so so smooth. I like it. basically I just ssh into it and play how I like. none of that monitor nonsense. just shell all the way. I love it. <br/><br/>&lt;3<br/><br/>i am going to open my ipod now.</p>
