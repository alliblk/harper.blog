<strong>Hi.</strong> I am an engineer who builds paradigm-shifting tech and leads others to do the same. I love using the enormity of the Internet to bring people together, whether as CTO of Obama for America, CTO at Threadless.com, or on my own projects. You can often find me playing with new technology, looking for something to hack, or enjoying life in Chicago with my amazing wife, Hiromi. Check out my <a href="http://harperreed.com">homepage</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=harper" target="_blank">follow me on twitter</a>.

    <p>i was so weird yesterday. I didn't want to be at work. so I just did my work without mentioning a word to anyone - and I reacted poorly when I was spoken too. it was <a href="http://womanstouch.ag.org/womanstouch/newimages/3-4-02/5_20_annoying%20guy.jpg">annoying</a> even to me.. I guess I was coming <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/featuregraphics/2002/07/20020702fossettballoon.jpg">down from the high</a> of my awesome (and tiring) weekend. I just wanted to go home and get a hug from someone. or go home and sleep (which is essentially what I did). It was funny - cuz I really <a href="http://www.digitalstoryteller.com/BTV99/hartley/images/small/0131BNSF_derailment_11-98.jpg">felt weird</a> - as though my batteries had worn down. but as soon as I was eating - I felt sooo much better to the point where I realized that the reason for the season was my lack of eating (the one thing I often forget to do). I need to remind myself to take better care of myself. I am really thinking of <a href="http://www.lovelylowrider.com/bulletbondobike.jpg">getting a bike</a>. but I want one I could possibly afford to lose (i tend to lose big things). I just know I would ride it to a bar and then wake up a week later and remember that it "was" locked to a pole by some bar. I don't think I would be happy if it was some fancy bike. ok. <br/><br/>i am better today though. it is nice to get sleep. I made my bed awesome so sleeping was really exciting. after sleeping it is easy to remember how <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~mysouthernfamily/photos/higginbothamjosephaCSAi17159.jpg">awesome my life really is</a>. ahhh.. umm. yea. <br/><br/>here is how to make a <a href="http://shitbegone.com/moneywallet/index2.html">money wallet</a>. here is how to <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=humor%2Fpictures&img=wrist.gif">ensure death</a> hehe. here is how to be <a href="http://www.rodrickbrown.com/denied.wmv">bummed out</a>. here is <a href="http://www.helenandbarry.com/WilliamHung.wmv">how to dance</a>. <br/><br/>this weekend is going tobe fun. we are having a small get-to-gether(hehe) on friday and then I have tickets to see ludacris and cannibal corpse. sounds like a winner. morgan's roommate is leaving soon so there is also a party for him.. he is really cool. check out his <a href="http://www.parallaxonline.org/index.html">site/company/ethics journal</a>. <br/><br/>don't forget to check out <a href="http://war.watership.org">war.watership.org</a> or to <a href="http://dopeman.org/ambient/">modify my ambient orb</a>.<br/><br/>i am bored today. I accidently went to a meeting that I wasn't supposed to goto. one ofmy bosses was like "harper.. uhh.. you shoudl leave ;)" it ruled. I am teh roxor for sure. hehe.<br/> ok enough</p>
