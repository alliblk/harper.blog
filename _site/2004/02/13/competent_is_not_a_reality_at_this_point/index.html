<strong>Hi.</strong> I am an engineer who builds paradigm-shifting tech and leads others to do the same. I love using the enormity of the Internet to bring people together, whether as CTO of Obama for America, CTO at Threadless.com, or on my own projects. You can often find me playing with new technology, looking for something to hack, or enjoying life in Chicago with my amazing wife, Hiromi. Check out my <a href="http://harperreed.com">homepage</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=harper" target="_blank">follow me on twitter</a>.

    <p>So I lost reality the other night. I was sittign at work - going live with this product (FINALLY) amd I noticed reality slinking out the door(<a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1076573111-picture(4).jpg">1</a>, <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1076573183-picture%281%29.jpg">2</a>, <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1076573365-picture%282%29.jpg">3</a>). I was pretty sure at that point that my life was going to get weird, so as any good boy would do - I just gave in and drank a lot more mt. dew. <br/>so what happened was this. we (WB) went live with this product on wednesday night. I was part of the night team  - so I had a bunch of <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1076562062-picture(2).jpg">pop, 6 fruit rollups and a bunch of peanuts</a> in about 3 hours. I then wanted to die. I stayed up <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1076562803-picture(2).jpg">delerious and wronged</a> until 9am with very very little sleep. I was able to have some fun though... and I did end up <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1076565230-picture(2).jpg">watching some movies</a>. once I left work I was able to go to wicker park - where I about died of horrible poisoning from the bastardized version of breakfast mcdonalds sells - and sleep. once asleep, I really didn't notice anything happening until I woke up. morgan then beat me up and punched me in the throat. we hung out. then I attempted to go home and crash hard. however, my inner child was rebelling and made me goto a shoe store to <a href="http://www.nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/photolog/1076686597-t610%281%29.jpg">buy future</a> <a href="http://www.citysoles.com/cs/products/03126f.html">shoes</a>. I made out like a bandit - a poor poor bandit. I then proceded to go home and sleep for not long enough. I hung out with matt and hiromi and then watched a bunch of dumb TV. it is nice it currently works. but it will soon stop I know it. I then went to morgans house to help her with her <a href="http://www.lathallan.com/timeline/Fullsize/0945am.jpg">secret project</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1076646915-t610(1).jpg">valentines day</a> is in the marrow. I didn't get my brother a bday present. I am a slacker. I should however. maybe I will get him a <a href=""></a>. maye not ;). morgan and I our going to go to see <a href="http://www.ticketmaster.com/artist/807285?tm_link=tm_home_g10">Monster Jam Monster Truck Racing</a> tommarrow night. I am thrilled. apparently a bunch of others are going as well. it will be an experience. for occasions like this, I am glad I have a mullet/rattail. I am able to blend in. heh. morgan however may have some issues - as she does have a mohawk. I will have to be extra hick I guess to make up for the lack of hick she possesses. possesses has a bundle of ss. haha. ss. esses?<br/><br/>tonight I am going to sleep a bunch. and then goto <a href="http://redrocketgallery.com/">lenore and jason's gallery</a>. I like gallery openings - especially when I am not interested in the art. it turns into such a social event. I love socials. then apparently there is a party. <br/><br/>i have strangely and unfortunantly run out of disposable income for the month.<br/><br/>i get to act the future man for sure.<br/><br/>my new shoes squeek and it cracks me up.<br/><br/>i have not yet recovered from my night up.</p>
