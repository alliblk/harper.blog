<strong>Hi.</strong> I am an engineer who builds paradigm-shifting tech and leads others to do the same. I love using the enormity of the Internet to bring people together, whether as CTO of Obama for America, CTO at Threadless.com, or on my own projects. You can often find me playing with new technology, looking for something to hack, or enjoying life in Chicago with my amazing wife, Hiromi. Check out my <a href="http://harperreed.com">homepage</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=harper" target="_blank">follow me on twitter</a>.

    <p>i just got home from work and hung out. chilled with rachel. got quiznos - which is near my house(weird. it just appeared). yea know the usual. I think rachel is gunna give me this old bike of hears. I will prolly paint penises all over it and call it the "cock rocket" - umm... I mean.. yea...<br/>
so after I hung out with rachel - I took a nap. I had meant to goto starsky and hutch - which is playing at the logan - but I accidently slept until 9:30. doh. so I walked to lula and got salmon. mmm <3 salmon. <br/><br/>check out this hilarious conversation I had today with some random person. haha.</p>

<p>HOW MY LIFE RULES. haha. I was like. wtf. then it was very funny. I don't really know how to react to that. other than laugh. I sent it to all my friends. haha. morgan was like "TELL HIM I MOVED OR DIED." hehe. rule. <br/><br/>hiromi works now. as does matt and matiss. so once again I have from 6 until around 10 to hang out with myself. which is awesome. I get SOOOO bored. heh. so I usually sleep. now I remember how I started taking naps. I guess I need to gather some friends - even though I apparently have some - I can't seem to find any from 6-9. <br/><br/>ok I guess I should goto bed. work is sucking lately. it was awesome. then suckage. stupid people who are not in aggrement with me. haha. well  whatever. I will fight the "good" battle and probably lose. but its cool. <br/><br/>i will post a surprise later tomorrow night. it will rule. you will smile.</p>
