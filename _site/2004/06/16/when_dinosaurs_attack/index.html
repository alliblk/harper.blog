<strong>Hi.</strong> I am an engineer who builds paradigm-shifting tech and leads others to do the same. I love using the enormity of the Internet to bring people together, whether as CTO of Obama for America, CTO at Threadless.com, or on my own projects. You can often find me playing with new technology, looking for something to hack, or enjoying life in Chicago with my amazing wife, Hiromi. Check out my <a href="http://harperreed.com">homepage</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=harper" target="_blank">follow me on twitter</a>.

    <p>so this day has been weird already and it is barely 9:30. first last night I got home from juggling club and was notified that my paypal account was terminated due to 3gscreensaver having porn on it. I actually don't know if that was the reason they just sent me a terse email with <a href="http://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=p/gen/ua/use/index_frame-outside&ed=mature">this</a> link. so I am assuming - unless they think <a href="http://www.savechrisfromprison.com">save chris</a> or <a href="http://www.weownthesun.com">we own the sun</a> is "mature" - it has to be <a href="http://www.3gscreensaver.com">3gscreensaver</a>. what is screwed up is that it is a user contributed system, so I didn't put the porn there. so I was tricked. but also it is messed up cuz the site was almost 2 years old. haha. so they have ignored it for two years. awesome. so now I am pretty much SOL for a lot of my commerce stuff. it sucks quite a bit. I guess I have to open a new paypal account and hope they don't cancel it. but my other paypal account had a rating of almost 600 - and had been open since the days of X.com. sad. anyway. I hate them. I may have lost the $150 that was in the account as well. it is sad. I will porbably try calling but I doesn't seem like it is any use. <br/><br/>on a much happier note I played a MEAN game of tetris today on the train. I started at level 9 and made it to level 15. I beat my personal high score of 100,000. rule. especially since it was in the 25 minute train ride I have. I didn't screw up once. I gotta play more. more more more. <br/><br/>i solved all my programming problems today in the shower. it ruled. hopefully it will work. nobody knows ;) <br/><br/>tonight is skinny puppy. I am pretty excited. <br/><br/>so I was chilling - reading my blog reader and I see the headline "<a href="http://www.edithfrost.com/index.php/weblog/harpers_so_funny/">Harper's so funny</a>" over at <a href="http://www.edithfrost.com/">edith's</a> page. hehe. I was like. woah. I win. haha. she was linking to <a href="http://www.dopeman.org/dylanhoody/">dylans hoody page</a>.  which I would like to point out is incomplete - cuz my punk little brother isn't cooperating and taking the much lauded action shots. someday. SOMEDAY. I tell you. <br/><br/>ok I am going to listen to death metal and do work.</p>
