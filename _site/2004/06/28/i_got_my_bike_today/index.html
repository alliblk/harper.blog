<strong>Hi.</strong> I am an engineer who builds paradigm-shifting tech and leads others to do the same. I love using the enormity of the Internet to bring people together, whether as CTO of Obama for America, CTO at Threadless.com, or on my own projects. You can often find me playing with new technology, looking for something to hack, or enjoying life in Chicago with my amazing wife, Hiromi.

    <p>this weekend was awesome. on thursday I hung out with a dope friend - we got <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&img=1088141512-Nokia6600(973).jpg">dinner and drinks</a> - it was pretty nice. I went home for a quick stop to say hi to my friends who were staying and then went to crobar - where a bunch of friends were. we somehow made it to vips. hahah. whatever. ;) then I went to bed. I find it pretty weird that I consider thursday the beginning of the weekend. heh. maybe that would explain my oft problematic friday morning. haha. anyway.. after thrusday...  I woke up sick. sad. I got a bit better throughout work and came home so we could leave for sheboygan. wtf.</p>

<p><br/><br/>so we left for sheboygan around 6 - and arrived around 9ish. it was pretty fun. we saw jake and his friends and chilled out. jake was a dork as usual. haha. then the next day there was a big breakfast at a park. it was a great time. we played a bunch of frisbee and bacci ball. bacci ball is pretty cool. I had never played and was very happy with the outcome. we lost the initial round of the tournament - but were able to weasel our way into officiating somehow and inaadvertently met everyone. it was a pretty nice time. then matt and I went back to our hotel and I took a nap. we went to a really bad resturant and I had some meat loaf(haha) and then we headed off to the wedding. <br/><br/>the wedding was at a very pretty camp groundish area somewhere near sheboygan. it was hard as hell to find and was next to a river. the ceremony was quite nice. very calm and very quick.  it was quick enough that their were no chairs for people to sit at - everyone stood. I wish all weddings were like this (DYLAN!!). weddings are weird thuogh. so after this. we all sat down for the reception and had a big dinner. talked a bunch and then started dancing. <br/><br/> we met soo many really nice people. and told sooo many really fun stories. it was quite nice. we danced a bunch too. I have never danced with so many graduate students - nor so many nurses. hopefully I will meet them all again. they were quite nice, smart and cute ;) &lt;3.
<br/><br/>then I got into a discussion about bush with  the bartender - and everyone left. so I did too. heh. matt and I drove back on sunday. I got home - attempted to fix my imac  - to no avail. it is broke. maybe witha  little work. haha. nah. I will try to sell it. for 5000. hah. umm. nope. nm. anyway. then we went and got some food. which was apparently not enough to tide me over. cuz I am hungry right now. but it was good at the time. I had an awesome asparagus soup. soooo soo good. then matiss and I rode our bikes to go see <a href="http://www.michaelmoore.com/">michael moores</a> new movie. <br/><br/></p>

<p>'<a href="http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/latestnews/f911facts/">Fahrenheit 9/11</a>' was pretty good. I think it would have been a lot better and more shocking if I hadn't been immersing myself in all this nonsense for the past three years. it was infuriating - and I was moved. a lot of it was plain sad and very hard to watch. I did cover my eyes a couple times. I don't like to  see some of that stuff. it is apparent that bush is an idiot - even though I don't really think that him sitting in a school room waiting is indeicative of that. I think a lot more of his actiosn and reactions were more insane than the morning of sept. 11th. but whatever. I thought the movie was quite quite good - and hoepfully good enough to make it to middle america. were these messages are needed the most. go see it. <a href="http://movies.channel.aol.com/showtimes/closesttheaters.adp?&_action=setLocation&exhibitorid=273&_zipcode=60657">here</a> is where I saw it. <br/><br/>ok I need to sleep. or eat. riding bikes is awesome.</p>
