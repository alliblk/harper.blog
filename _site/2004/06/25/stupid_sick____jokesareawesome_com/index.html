<strong>Hi.</strong> I am an engineer who builds paradigm-shifting tech and leads others to do the same. I love using the enormity of the Internet to bring people together, whether as CTO of Obama for America, CTO at Threadless.com, or on my own projects. You can often find me playing with new technology, looking for something to hack, or enjoying life in Chicago with my amazing wife, Hiromi. Check out my <a href="http://harperreed.com">homepage</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=harper" target="_blank">follow me on twitter</a>.

    <p>i hate being sick. it totally blows. I love black metal. I really don't know how they are related. but I have listened to black metal for the last couple months. and it rules. today was all emporer.
<br/><br/>i got bored of choosign music for my ipod - so I let itunes do it this time. it did a pretty good job. I am proud. <br/><br/>anyway. last night I played yoyo and cleaned my room. it was cool. I got these new bearings for my yoyojam hitmen (:P) and they are <a href="http://www.dif-e-yo.com/konkave.htm">"konkave"</a> so the string rests on the center and then the yoyo acts very smooth. rico suave. it rules. tricks for years. <br/><br/></p>

<p>check this out. haha. <a href="http://nata2.info">nata2.info</a> rules. it has an <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;url=nata2.info">alexa traffic rank</a> of 96,525 and is constantly being blocked by web proxies. haha. my friends told him this:</p>

<p>the best part is - that I put all my pictures and such there - so everyone I know "goes" there to check stuff out. but they have to wade through pounds and pounds of stuff that is catagorized as "Tasteless/Gross, Jokes, Profanity, Nudity, Sex." I rule. <br/><br/>oh oh oh. I remember. I have a new site. it is a pretty cool little site for jokes. most are really bad. but I kept thinkgin to myself - I should write these jokes I have in my head down. and then I was like. naw. I don't want to do any of that work. so I made this new site: <br/>
<a href="http://jokesareawesome.com/">http://jokesareawesome.com/</a>
<br/>
it rules. it took like 2 hours to build.  and hopefully the joke library will grow. whee. <br/><br/>tonight is crobar rock night. it should be fun. if you want to go - show up and drop my name. haha. so funny. but yea. I am going to dinner with s friend and then to crobar. the sad thing is that I am sick - and that my friend sarah and her fiance matt are in town - but I have to "work." and by work I mean goto a club and be cool. I love my life. programming web apps. fixing servers. makign yoyo sites. yoyoing. clubbing. ladies and finally being awesome. oh yes. it is true. <br/><br/>i will probably regret being such a dork at some point. but not now. that is for damn sure. <br/><br/>i want my bike.</p>
