<strong>Hi.</strong> I am an engineer who builds paradigm-shifting tech and leads others to do the same. I love using the enormity of the Internet to bring people together, whether as CTO of Obama for America, CTO at Threadless.com, or on my own projects. You can often find me playing with new technology, looking for something to hack, or enjoying life in Chicago with my amazing wife, Hiromi.

    <p>so I finally put the pictures up and here is the "annotated" guide to my photos. there are a bunch that I didn't include. check them out <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india">here</a>. I am not done. so I will be adding or modifying this entry soon. haha. word. <br/><br/>
so on sunday we drove from delhi to agra. on the way I saw a <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&amp;img=IMG_0081.jpg">snake charmer</a> and a picture of a <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&amp;img=IMG_0086.jpg">guy with a crazy mustache</a>. <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&amp;img=IMG_0101.jpg">here is me</a> in front of the taj mahal. the <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&amp;img=IMG_0107.jpg">taj mahal was incredible</a>. I am pretty sure that <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&amp;img=IMG_0109.jpg">this</a> is the guest house. the marble work was <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&amp;img=IMG_0117.jpg">insane</a>. seriously. you have no idea. apparently <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&amp;img=IMG_0124.jpg">this</a> is a famous place to take a picture. <br/><br/>after we saw the taj we went to the <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&amp;img=IMG_0131.jpg">red fort</a>. it was also pretty <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&img=IMG_0135.jpg">crazy and intricate</a>. from here you can see the <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&img=IMG_0147.jpg">taj pretty good</a>. apparently the guy that made the taj was banished to the red fort and was made to look on to his creation until he died. <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&img=IMG_0145.jpg">this is his fountain</a> and <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&img=IMG_0146.jpg">this is his bedroom</a>. it was a nice bedroom. the work in the red stone  is very intricate. it is also <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&img=IMG_0157.jpg">insane</a>.   <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&img=IMG_0162.jpg">here</a> is one of my guides and i. <br/><br/>on the way back from agra to delhi I noticed a trend that I had never seen before. apaprently they buy the <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&img=IMG_0175.jpg">chassis</a> of the <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&img=IMG_0176.jpg">truck separate</a> from the truck and take it to another place to add the body. I think that <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&img=IMG_0179.jpg">this</a> is a mosque. <br/><br/>in delhi I saw <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&img=IMG_0222.jpg">this</a> amazing Bah?'? Temple. it was so <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&img=IMG_0223.jpg">spectacular</a> at night. <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&img=IMG_0227.jpg">here</a> is one of the auto-rickshaws that are everywhere. and as per usual I had to <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&img=IMG_0236.jpg">get on the plane</a> while it was parked on the tarmack. this has happened in frankfurt, delhi and bangalore. hehe. it is pretty awesome though. <br/><br/>so I flew to bangalore - which is an incredible city. as I flew in I could tell that it was a nice climate and that I would like it. since the elections are in full swing, they have <A href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0239.jpg">election signs</a> up all over. also a lot of <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0241.jpg">technology signs</a> and a lot of <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0242.jpg">construction</a>. all the construction apparently ends up looking like <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0256.jpg">this</a> but starts out looking like <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0257.jpg">this</a>. <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0258.jpg">here </a> is the unicorn house. and of course the <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0283.jpg">nike  factory store</a>.  there are a ton of <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0282.jpg">brightly painted trucks</a> everywhere. some of the <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0298.jpg">advertisments</a> really crack me up. <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0307.jpg">this </a> is apparently a free hospital. it looks pretty cool and is only  about 5 years old. <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0310.jpg">this</a> is itpl where I have been working for the past couple days. on the first night my friends took me to MG road which has <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0311.jpg">bunches of stores and such</a>. I took <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0345.jpg">this picture</a> for my more askew friends. the guest house where I stayed is <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=STE_0316.jpg">really nice</a>. it has a <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0346.jpg">pool</a>.   my friends <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0349.jpg">guru and siddu</a> took me around a bunch - as has <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0355.jpg">suresh</a>.  suresh took me to a <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0354.jpg">club</a> where I hung out with some of his <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0353.jpg">friends</a>.<br/><br/>so that is it so far. I plan to get a bunch more pictures in the next couple days of chruchs, temples and my friends. hoepfully I will see some good stuff. like I said before. I practice the <a href="http://www.lomography.com/content/about/rules/">rules</a> of <a href="http://www.lomography.com/">lomography</a> (even though I am digital) so some of the pictures may be lame ;). but whatever.</p>
