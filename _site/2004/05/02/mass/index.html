<strong>Hi.</strong> I am an engineer who builds paradigm-shifting tech and leads others to do the same. I love using the enormity of the Internet to bring people together, whether as CTO of Obama for America, CTO at Threadless.com, or on my own projects. You can often find me playing with new technology, looking for something to hack, or enjoying life in Chicago with my amazing wife, Hiromi. Check out my <a href="http://harperreed.com">homepage</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=harper" target="_blank">follow me on twitter</a>.

    <p>today I went downtown and picked up  voltage converter and some clothes. everyone has been telling me to go and get light colored clothing so that I don't A) burn up and B) get attacked by bugs. apparently there are a lot of bugs. I am not a fan of disease so I guess I will head their suggestions. stupid disease. so I got some clothes. mostly brown pants and nice <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1083449032-Nokia6600(562).jpg">blue and white shirts</a>. haha. I went to h and m and they were rather busy. there was s huge line for the dressing room. I hate lines like that. mostly because it seemed to occupied by people whom I woudl HATE to be in line with. haha. versus all the lines I like which are obviously occupied with people I WANT to be in line with. wtf. yea nobody knows. <br/><br/>i think it is weird that skinny puppy is touring again. <br/><br/>i feel a little better today. I really wonder if the weather is effecting my mood. I mean. it obviously is. cuz the weather is dreary and I am dreary. I listened to a bunch of death metal while I was downtown. that ruled. I wished the whole tiem I was walking around with a huge "ghettoblaster" and listening to the same music. it is the same daydream that involved me and a seven series bmw - listening to maiden. ahh. I love that dream. <br/><br/>i am getting pretty excited. I have to get my malaria medicine and bug spray. I think that is about it. oh and all sorts of misc stuff I keep forgetting about. <br/><br/>the new dead prez album is quite good. I think it is  interesting how violent it is. someday I will see isis. <br/><br/>someday summer will be here too. <br/><br/>wtf. everyone is all "yea I will goto mean girls.." and then they don't go. seriously.</p>
