<strong>Hi.</strong> I am an engineer who builds paradigm-shifting tech and leads others to do the same. I love using the enormity of the Internet to bring people together, whether as CTO of Obama for America, CTO at Threadless.com, or on my own projects. You can often find me playing with new technology, looking for something to hack, or enjoying life in Chicago with my amazing wife, Hiromi. Check out my <a href="http://harperreed.com">homepage</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=harper" target="_blank">follow me on twitter</a>.

    <p>so I can now make international calls to everyone. if you want to prank me - dial 9880281475. hah. umm yea. or something like that. I will try and set up an sms gateway so you can leave me messages. or I won't whatever. <br/><br/>i will post pictures soon. I promise.
<br/><br/>now I need food. it is lunch time. which is weird I know - since I am posting this at 2:15 am. ;)<Br><br/>last night guru took me around to MG road (which is a lot like manhatten - weird) and we just hung out. I got my prepaid card and we ate some food. I also found some bottled water (w00t) and then had some beers. the bar was really fun. it was a ROCK bar and had pictures of rockers all around. I sat under a picture of frank zappa. it ruled. I shoudl have taken a picture. then we took a cab home and I went to bed. I woke up and discovered that there isn't hot water. nor a shower curtain. so I lathered myself up and sprayed freezing water at myself. I taste like soap still. so cold.. I then ate an incredible breakfast. it was good. dosas with coconut chutney... mmm... and then went to work. I inadvertently found out  how to dial internationally and called alan and morgan. it was nice to talk to people I know. it is weird. I find myself struggling with a bit of culture shock. yesterday all I wanted was a sandwich. so I had one. today I just wanted to say hi to someone I knew. tomorrow I will probably want to get drunk and wrestle. yea know. the drill. <Br><br/>i woudl probably like to come back. <Br><br/>work is going well. it is nice cuz everyone here is all about getting work done - whereas in chicago - it is all about designing which is soo much more beurocratic(spelled horribly I am sure). the difference is very apparent when we have 1 one hour meeting that has results - versus a billion 2 hour meetings that spawn that 1 one hour meeting. I guess both are necessary - it is just amazing to see how fast everything gets done when the hard parts(design/content stuff) are already done. hehe. I guess I am saying I like the easy part. how lame am i. haha. suckers. I am in india. hahah. <Br><br/>ok I better go before I hurt myself.</p>
