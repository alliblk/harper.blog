<strong>Hi.</strong> I am an engineer who builds paradigm-shifting tech and leads others to do the same. I love using the enormity of the Internet to bring people together, whether as CTO of Obama for America, CTO at Threadless.com, or on my own projects. You can often find me playing with new technology, looking for something to hack, or enjoying life in Chicago with my amazing wife, Hiromi.

    <p>however, I don't feel very tired. I really don't understand how it is that I am able to lead this weird dual life. my friend adam equated it to the original mods from the 50s and 60s. he said they used to have normal jobs(working 9-5) and look like business people - then after work they would transform into these fashion seeking scene people. right after my friend adam told me this he started shouting "prolatariet." but anyway - I sometimes don't understand how I find my self at work less than 6 hours after I was last "out." regardless of the activity - I am always "out" before going to work. weird. I am lost in my typing.</p>

<p><Br><br/>so this weekend was pretty fun. it as always started on thursday with <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A07_tommie_at_metro&img=IMG_1964.jpg">tommie spinning</a> at smartbar. <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A07_tommie_at_metro&img=IMG_1954.jpg">danielle</a> and I <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A07_tommie_at_metro&img=IMG_1958.jpg">hung out</a> there. a lot of fun. I wasn't really into being crazy and danielle wsa tired and claims not to be a dancer(we will soon see the truth) - so it was a pretty chill night out. a lot of fun. I took a <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A07_tommie_at_metro&img=IMG_1968.jpg">neat picture</a> of <a href="http://morganbreaksthings.blogspot.com/">morgan</a> and <a href="http://thatswherebatslive.blogspot.com/">miles</a>.</p>

<p><br/><br/>on friday I went home after work and changed into my "young republican" clothing to enable me to participate in my local political gathering. I met <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A09_debates_and_crobar&img=IMG_1978.jpg">scott, jeff</a> and <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A09_debates_and_crobar&img=IMG_1979.jpg">monica</a> at frankie Zs bar on clark for a kerry event to support him during the debates. it was pretty fun. I think we were rowdy.  and then with stops to hard rock hotel bar, sugar and a porn store, we finally made it to crobar. heh. were we met <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A09_debates_and_crobar&img=IMG_1982.jpg">hiromi</a>. it was pretty fun. my friend <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A09_debates_and_crobar&img=IMG_1990.jpg">tracy</a> and a bunch of her friends also participated in the insanity. it was a pretty fun night. after crobar - we went to redno, and then my friend james' space for an after hours and then to scotts house. omg. I got home at around 6:30am. I was not aware that flash taco has a closing time. haha. <br/><br/>so then on saturday I needed to rest. so I did. I went to bed bath and beyond and picked up some stuff with matiss. the sales people reacted pretty funny to us. I mean we don't look your typical lincoln park hotties. well I don't matiss on the other hand. seriously looks LP. totally trixie. it ruled. so now I can't wait for the cold to come. all I want to do is to snuggle into my bed. with soft things and read books that are dark. dark like my heart. after our excursion - I went with hiromi and jordan to a bbq. and then I went to corbar to pick up some money that jordan was owed. we drank lots and forgot the money. stupid bars. then I went to bed. pretty early for a saturday. I missed hanging out with some people which sucked. but I got to sleep. <Br><br/>so on sunday - I played a bunch of video games with matt and matiss. it ruled. then I returned some stuff to BBB. heh. lame. then I went to an awesome bbq at chao's house. then game night at my place. we played this awesome game called bang. and then a couple games of speed scrabble. at that time I went to claudia's BBQ at this guy lloyds house. it was fun. really really good pork chops. heh. I love bbqs. after the bbq I went to exit with devon. it was fun to hang out. we then went to her place and had tea and hung out with her dog. I got home at 3. and slept really well. <br/><br/>this week will bring some fun stuff going down. I am finally getting work to do at my job. we are in the middle of launching some stuff so everything si really on hold. I will soon be effective. haha. <br/><br/>my friends are all going to india in january. stupid non-corporate workers. I want to go.</p>
