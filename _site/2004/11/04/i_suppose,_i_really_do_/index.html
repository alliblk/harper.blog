<strong>Hi.</strong> I am an engineer who builds paradigm-shifting tech and leads others to do the same. I love using the enormity of the Internet to bring people together, whether as CTO of Obama for America, CTO at Threadless.com, or on my own projects. You can often find me playing with new technology, looking for something to hack, or enjoying life in Chicago with my amazing wife, Hiromi. Check out my <a href="http://harperreed.org">homepage</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=harper" target="_blank">follow me on twitter</a>.

    <p>so basically I haven't updated this thing in about 3 years. which is a long time. so I am going to "update" yall as to my whereabouts. <br/><br/>so. I got this new job. it is taking a lot of my time. it rules. but I am in a different paradigm than I was when I was at the WB. basically I am totally engaged for 8 hours. I have to be much more accountable and I have to really justify my actions. this is good for me. it is a situation which allows me to grow. and if things work out how they "should" then I will be sitting pretty. maybe I will win. my goal is to be in a place that gives me the freedom to do what I would normally do (just fuck around all day) but in a corporate environment which I get rewarded in. I think this may be it. I am pretty excited. or I will get fired for looking at porn as usual. <br/><br/>so I am pretty disappointed in the election results. but I feel that we got our just deserve. the american people have spoken. and we now get to live with the results. so I guess now we need to just make sure we don't blow everyone up. I am doubtful things will get a lot better. I just hope it stays entertaining. and it will. I know it. <br/><br/>i haxored my tivo something fierce. I am currently downloading the election night daily show to burn to a cd and give to matiss. then he can watch it. awesome. I rule. <br/><br/>i want to be fancier. soon. I think my new goal is to make my apartment a cyborg apartment. with robots. I wanna get rid of all the crap I got on ebay. and make the place fancy. like with some interesting computer integrated experiments. I think it will rule. speaking of that. I need to send invoices. or I am going to be making a computer aided sad face when I lose all my moneys. <br/>
stupid stupid moneys. <br/><br/>stupid monkeys. <br/><br/>so this weekend was awesome. I went to nyc to hang out. I got <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A31_halloween_nyc">pictures</a> to prove it.

I also was able to see some of my <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A31_halloween_nyc&img=IMG_2234.jpg">friends</a> <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A31_halloween_nyc&img=IMG_2281.jpg">from afar</a>.

I had three costomes. the first was a <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A31_halloween_nyc&img=IMG_2255.jpg">magic man</a> - although I told everyone I was nelson mandela, the second I don't have any pictures of - but I was also a magic man (this time red), the third and the best I was a <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A31_halloween_nyc&img=IMG_2420.jpg">playboy</a> <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A31_halloween_nyc&img=IMG_2422.jpg">bunny</a>. here is tommie as a <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A31_halloween_nyc&img=IMG_2429.jpg">girl</a>. and of course -
