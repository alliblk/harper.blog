<strong>Hi.</strong> I am an engineer who builds paradigm-shifting tech and leads others to do the same. I love using the enormity of the Internet to bring people together, whether as CTO of Obama for America, CTO at Threadless.com, or on my own projects. You can often find me playing with new technology, looking for something to hack, or enjoying life in Chicago with my amazing wife, Hiromi. Check out my <a href="http://harperreed.com">homepage</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=harper" target="_blank">follow me on twitter</a>.

    <p>Today is weird. I worked from 9 to 5 twice in 24 hours. That is a lot of work. I am totally of the school of thought that you should always pace yourself. 16 hours with a 3 hour break isn't really pacing myself. But whatever - it is the same sxhedule I sometimes have with going out and work - and I don't complain then. Heh.<br/><br/></p>

<p>Today I got a letter from my friend ella from taiwan. It was exciting. I took some pictures of what she sent me. I will possibly explain later.<br/><br/></p>

<p>The more stressful work is for me the less I blog. Stupid work.<br/><br/></p>

<p>Today I installed sp2 - bluescreened 5 times - uninstalled it - bluescreened 5 more times for no reason. Hate.<br/><br/></p>

<p>Wtf did microsoft do to make itself incompatible with its own transparency api deal. Hahah. Ny vocab is awesome.<br/><br/></p>

<p>I am writing this entry on the train. My thumbs hurt. I wish I could just think entries. But if I could - yall wouldn't read this - cuz it would be LONG and weird. I would talk about my demon bunny dreams and my conversations about robot ranches - which would naturally lead to the discussion about the asimov short story where cars killed humans.<br/><br/></p>

<p>I rode my bike a bunch on sunday. I rode to cole and melissa's house for a bbq. Theb to the metro for fear factory. Then home. All in all about 1 billion miles. I was tired.<br/><br/></p>

<p>I sa garden state on sunday night. I don't know about it. It totally reminded me how I don't have a gf. It was awesome. I was like "sweet I am lonely and hollywood knows it." Stupid stupid hollywood. Btw I am totally not lonely. I am such a MAN.<br/><br/></p>

<p>Almost home.<br/><br/></p>

<p>Almost in bed.<br/><br/></p>

<p>Today Is gunna be so weird.<br/><br/></p>

<p>I think my life is either about to come together or explode.<br/><br/></p>

<p>I hope either one is a big mess.<br/><br/>
btw. it is a beautiful day out.</p>
