<strong>Hi.</strong> I am an engineer who builds paradigm-shifting tech and leads others to do the same. I love using the enormity of the Internet to bring people together, whether as CTO of Obama for America, CTO at Threadless.com, or on my own projects. You can often find me playing with new technology, looking for something to hack, or enjoying life in Chicago with my amazing wife, Hiromi. Check out my <a href="http://harperreed.org">homepage</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=harper" target="_blank">follow me on twitter</a>.

    <p>i feel better. even matt said I looked and acted more chilled out. I really feel more chilled out. morgan and I talked and came to a point where we are in the same space/place. I think it will work out. we obviously have to redefine our relationship. and how we work together. but that is totally fine and completely appropriate. I think she said it best with an analogy to the gears in a car. going from 3rd gear to 1st. obviously there are some hiccups but we get to keep driving. hahahah. omg. I can't believe I just typed that. must resist urge to modify. haha.
<br/><br/>this whole situation has put my blog back in to a journal state which is interesting. for a long time it was pretty much link posting and commentary. I haven't really posted much super personal stuff. I keep getting asked if it is weird to post shit like this. I think it is totally weird  - but it is also super cathartic for me. and I really feel it helps me think. I usually write something then go back and edit it and revise it. and finally I have my thoughts sorted out. so.. I guess I could do it in notepad or something. but I am a blogger. heh. I wonder if I should start swearing in my blogs more. I cuss like a sailor. however I usually keep the blog friendly. heh. I will think about it. ;)<br/><br/>tonight was juggling club. before hand I ate at johnnys grill - which is super sketchy at times - this was one of those times. I totally felt a little woozy afterwards and wanted to lay down. but I had to juggle and yoyo a bunch. haha. it ruled. I like hanging out with <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1080101255-Nokia6600(006).jpg">matiss and mark</a>. then I came home and laid around. watched pirates of the carribean. and screwed around with my fancy ibook picture frame. I separated all the <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1080109043-Nokia6600(010).jpg">non-essential parts</a> and then put it in an <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1080111718-Nokia6600(014).jpg">old amazon box</a>. it even <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1080111294-Nokia6600(012).jpg">booted in the amazon box</a>. I think this project rules. it is a lot of fun working with matt. heh. I think we are going to find a really nice frame and set it in there. I am still incredibly surprised how freaking thin it ended up once I stripped all the non-essential pieces out.
the next step is writing an application to do all the things we want our fancy picture frame to do. I think we want it to display pictures we define, display pictures we email it, and display pictures from nata2.info. also there should be a new ticker mode that will display all our blogs and news feeds. possibly stream cspan. hahah. something else maybe. I would like to also incorporate it into some webapp. so that web users can mess with it as well. maybe have a text scroller along the bottom that will last for 10 minutes per message or something. I was thinking of doing it all in flash and php/xml. it will rule. I will of course relase the application and let yall play. <br/><br/>now sleep. I gotta 8:30 meeting with my boss in the morning. hopefully it will be good. I don't think I could really handle any more strife right now. ;)</p>
