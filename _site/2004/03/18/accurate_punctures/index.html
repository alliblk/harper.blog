        <p>so I went and got accupuncture last night. I think I am done for a bit. I originally went to alleviate some back pain I had gained from wrestling - however the back pain is gone. so wheni arrived yesterday I realized that I really had know ailments for her to manipulate. I was perfect. so the session ended up just being weird and boring I mean.. it isn't really suppsoed to be entertaining - but I got tired of it and was suddenly done. this coupled with my unusually high(apparently) pain threshold made for a strangely unpleasent experience. she kept doing these things and asking me if they hurt. heh. none of them ever hurt - however my back is relaly sore today. she warned me of that - but I was like "yeah yeah yeah." whatever. haha. the one thing that was shocking - is that she put a needle into my finger and it totally destroyed my hand in pain. it was madness. total madness. my mind stopping paying attention to reality for a second - enough time to render the pain as a spindly set of wires shooting up my arm. insane. after I exclaimed my concerns over the shooting/stabbing/destroying pain in my hand - she removed the needle and it was gone. score one nerves. score zero acupuncture.<br></p>

<br>


<p>one of the weirdest side effects of the acupuncture was the emotion weirdness that happens afterwards. hiromi had mentioned that she is super weird afterwards and I experienced this after the last session. but it is still pretty weird. for the most part I am a relatively levelheaded person. oh sure I am crazy sometimes - but overall I am not a sad person. however both times after my accupuncture I felt really low confidence and totally out of place and time. the accupuncturist women described it as being "stoned" - heh. I don't know about that but it certain is a bit disconcerting to know that when I come back from the weird "<a href="http://www.goodlifemagnets.com/acupuncture.gif">needle massage</a>" that I am going to be an emotional wreck for the next four hours.<br></p>

<br>


<p>heh. so anyway. last night I got back from the crazy with machine and hung out a bit at home. morgan called and then I called back and acted like a crazy person. seriously. I didn't make sense - and I wasn't able to form sentences. those two may be related. so I just chilled - then went to watusi to hang out and see people and drink beers. after beers we went home. it was a fun night. morgans friend leslie is fun.<br></p>

<br>


<p>my <b>birthday</b> is on <a href="http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/March%2021">sunday</a>. get me <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/registry.html/002-0276114-2914465?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;id=24TWA6NT9YXAS">gifts</a>.<br></p>

<br>


<p>today is totally a weird day. I keep nodding off at my desk. not really sleeping - just not existing. well.. ok sleeping. but only for a sec. it is really annoying. and we didn't really stay up that late. I mean maybe until 3:30am haha. but not until 5 or 6. ok delerium setting in. wait..<br></p>

<br>


<p>i often laugh at what becomes news worthy in our media. for instance: <a href="http://drudgereport.com/kerryid1.htm">Kerry unloaded italian mansion month he decided white house run</a>. wtf. why is this important. is it important because he was able to use some of the money to support his candidacy? the article doesn't really say - it just doesn't really make any sense why this is news worthy. UNLESS!! it is on the case of <a href="http://andrew_redux.blogs.com/redux/2004/02/john_kerry_anti.html">kerry being a communist</a> and owning overseas property which demonstrates his honest support of <a href="http://www.tradingwebspaces.com/archives/breakroom2.jpg">bin laden and the al qaeda</a>. I knew it.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i think it is disappointing to see the power that <a href="http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/8199068.htm?template=contentModules/printstory.jsp">jesus still has</a>. man religion is wack. I know so few <a href="http://mattroanwillkickyourass.com/">cool christians</a> that it makes me sad. I wonder though.. how is "the passion" different from chick's <a href="http://www.chick.com/catalog/videos/LOTW.asp">light of the world</a>. both are "truth." both contain interpretations of the <a href="http://www.bible-christian-heritage.co.uk/images/bible.9.jpg">christian bible</a>(versus the <a href="http://home.online.no/~corneliu/extreme.html">church of appliantology</a> bible). and both are made by evil men. well I guess the <a href="http://www.hkdvdmart.com/a1/dvdmart/image/chick.jpg">chick dvd</a> isn't really a movie. it is more of a slide show. but really - aren't both attempting to stir up some hate against the truth naysayers.. anyway. it is all pretty weird to me. I would vote for jesus if he were running against bush. that is for sure.<br>
<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;cid=519&amp;u=/ap/20040318/ap_on_re_us/college_hate_crime_1&amp;printer=1">this</a> is very interesting and not really very surprising. heh. scalia is insane. once I met him at college. we drank wine together and discussed the <a href="http://www.project2061.org/tools/sfaaol/chap1.htm">nature of science</a> and its <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/dept/HPST/SciMedOrg/presentations/AlliKraus/img013.jpg">relationship to religion</a> - from a catholic point of view. hah. he didn't say "<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2004-02-06-cheney-scalia_x.htm">quack</a>" once. which was too bad. I would have liked to talk duck with him.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i wonder how long we can act like <a href="http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/columns/shoptalk_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000465506">this</a> isn't a problem. I would guess a long time. we have <a href="http://www.washtimes.com/national/20040317-105827-1441r.htm">lots</a> of other <a href="http://news.myway.com/top/article/id/256517|top|03-18-2004::10:04|reuters.html">things</a> to <a href="http://www.eubusiness.com/afp/040318101927.gsn430bz">think about</a>.<br></p>

<br>


<p>oh check out this site I made the other day: <a href="http://www.swampsugar.net">swampsugar.net</a>. I like it. it looks good. has a good theme and works well in almost all browsers. I didn't test netscape 4.7. mostly because I hate netscape 4.7. hate is a strong word - and is appropriately used when refering to the <a href="http://www.hobbytyme.com/mdse/ver1444.jpg">devil incarnate</a> that is netscape 4.7.<br></p>

<br>


<p>whew. ok. I get a haircut tonight. I am looking a little <a href="http://www.nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/photolog/1079548717-t610%282%29.jpg">rough</a>. heh. ok. I feel better. I think I need to take tonight off. maybe hang with my roomies. or maybe morgan. but NOT go out. even though the assassins are playing (although I should be boycotting them wtf) and I woudl see all my friends. I think I just need to sit on the couch and veg. heh. maybe goto a movie. just remain unmoved. soemthing. my fingers are out of control. they won't let me stop typing.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i REALLY want my new phone. it is supposed to be delievered today. TODAY I tell you. oh and myspace profiles are unprotected. heh. check it out: <a href="http://www.myspace.com/247819.usr">mine</a>, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/383329.usr">brocks</a> and <a href="http://www.myspace.com/813235.usr">morgans</a>. weird eh. I wonder if that is a feature or a bug. you can crawl the myspace site. heh. I am goign to write a program to do it real quick like. it will rule. brb.<br></p>
