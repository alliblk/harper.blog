<strong>Hi.</strong> I am an engineer who builds paradigm-shifting tech and leads others to do the same. I love using the enormity of the Internet to bring people together, whether as CTO of Obama for America, CTO at Threadless.com, or on my own projects. You can often find me playing with new technology, looking for something to hack, or enjoying life in Chicago with my amazing wife, Hiromi. Check out my <a href="http://harperreed.com">homepage</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=harper" target="_blank">follow me on twitter</a>.

    <p>i just hate the fact that I am unable to use MMS. <br/><br/>i seriously need to save my money. I am always running out of money. wtf. I guess my fasion lifestyle I established when I was a baller doesn't transcend well to the non-baller status I am currently exhibiting. doh! or lack there of. :(<br/><br/>i say this rant as I prepare to go out to sushi and a <i>super</i> (hah) club with my friends later. it is going to be really fun. I think that the people who will be in attendence are: chris, claudia, virgin tears guys, hiromi, mark, matt, derek, kari, morgan and myself. it is gunna rule. <3 clubs with friends. seirously. so much fun. we are supposed to meet at sushi wabi for dinner at around 9. which should be FULL of fun. a bucket.<br/><br/>so things with morgan seem to have cleared up a bit. it is nice. she came over and we just hung out and played games. exactly what I wanted to do. I really like her and it is nice that things have worked out for the better. last weekend was pretty sad - but I think it will make our relationship stronger. and more resilent to nuclear war. I hate nuclear war - however I love nucular war. Love. <br/><br/>i need to get a frame so we can mount my <a href="http://ironkungfu.com/wiki/index.php/picture%20frame%20ibook">ibook friend</a>. however I think I need to reinstall osx before that (mostly cuz I have to put the cdrom back in <b>;)</b>). I am really excited about it. I think it is going to turn out really well. if it looks at all like a picture I will be so happy. one of the things I have to figure out is how to remove all the power saving features from osX. so that the screen doesn't blank or anything. also I need to figure out how to control it. I am thinking about useing a <a href="http://www.keyspan.com/products/usb/remote/">infrared remote</a>. I think that would be awesome. but there is also always bluetooth. one of the funniest things about this project is how I have two audreys sitting in my room doing nothing. just chilling. wtf. haha. they could easily become internet terminals. haha. umm whatever. I wish I coudl get QNX to boot on the ibook. then it woudl be really really easy to create this app. or maybe linux. hmm. I guess I will have to invetigate a bit. <br/><br/>morgan has a hair show this weekend. I wonder what her hair will be like on sunday. heh. I LOVE crazy hair cuts. my new one is so awesome. its theme was "camaro." hah. it looks it. I almost have a crew cut with a mullet/rattail. hah. awesome. <br/><br/>speaking of camaros. I think I may still be getting one. I keep finding local ones for aroun 1200 and that seems reasonable. I am thinkign that I will sell my car and spend half of that money buying a camaro. then giving <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_6600&amp;img=Nokia6600%28022%29.jpg">morgan</a>, <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_6600&amp;img=Nokia6600%28023%29.jpg">matt</a> and joe free reign to "fix" it up. I just hope we don't have to add a t-top. that seems like it would be a pain. <br/><br/>i made a <a href="http://blogs.nata2.org/lite.php">lite version</a> of the <a href="http://blogs.nata2.org/">nata2 blogs</a> page for all yall with pdas, <a href="http://ironkungfu.com/wiki/index.php/sidekick">sidekicks</a> and cool <a href="http://ironkungfu.com/wiki/index.php/nokia%206600">cell phones</a>. so yea. I am a fan of divs and css. if only I was a designer and had skillz in the design field. <bR><br/>hah. if only I was a speller and had skillz in the spelling field. <br/><br/>so back to my new phone. I relaly like it. however I think the OS is a bit kludgy. it really annoys me. like startign the camera is not relaly instantaneous. for $400 it shoudl be damn fast. also - the selection of applications is a little ot be desired. <br/><br/>i wish a mobloging standard would emerge. I should start emailing people around the community. if we all adopted a way of mobloging with these phones - then maybe a good application will emerge and mobloging will be easy and fun. it could be xmlrpc based or whatever. right now I am using email - which works but I feel there HAS to be a better way to do it. <br/><br/>enough.</p>
