<strong>Hi.</strong> I am an engineer who builds paradigm-shifting tech and leads others to do the same. I love using the enormity of the Internet to bring people together, whether as CTO of Obama for America, CTO at Threadless.com, or on my own projects. You can often find me playing with new technology, looking for something to hack, or enjoying life in Chicago with my amazing wife, Hiromi. Check out my <a href="http://harperreed.com">homepage</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=harper" target="_blank">follow me on twitter</a>.

    <p>i fixed it. well I thought I did. until it wouldn't reload. I think that our internet <a href="http://www.worldbook.com">here</a> is really slow. I can't even ssh to my boxen. weird. and dumb. wierd and dumb. together at last. man it has been a long caffiene drenched day. umm. yea. so anyway. my original post was going to be like this: so I modified my photolog recently - I made it so the most recent picture shows up on all the pages and then I revamped the photolog to be displayed by month. it looks a little better and is quite a bit quicker. however I could <a href="http://www.xcassociates.com/pics/LEAP.JPG">significantly increase</a> the speed if I wasn't reading the directory as much. I am lazy though and don't want to learn perl DB stuff. heh. but anyway. it looks pretty good. I think with the advent of my 6600 -  I will make the perl script that posts the pictures resize and submit the filenames and such to a db. it will be oh so much faster then it is now. <br/><br/>last night we all hung out at my house and yoyoed and chilled. it was fun. I learned about 3 super nifty yoyo tricks and I really am excited to goto juggling tonight. whippee. <br/><br/><a href="http://morgan.attacktexas.com">morgan</a> got a <a href="http://www.crunch.com">promotion</a>. nice work. <br/><br/>tired. nap time is fast approaching. I think I have tricked my body into wanting naps everyday from  4-7. it is OK but also suxors. cuz I get sleepy REAL easy. but tonight I will have PLENTY of time to sleep before juggling. k. I have accupuncture again on thursday. I think she will say the same stuff: you shoudl do an activity that stretches your shoulders" - I shoudl do an activity that makes me move altogether. I really am feeling like I shoudl by a bike. I will probably get a really simple hybred? hmm like a used bike that isn't a mountain bike but isn't a road bike. and screw the track bikes. I just need one to get around in the <a href="http://www.mts.net/~mkrieger/folio/spring.jpg">spring and summer</a>. I guess I also have to start goign places. suddenly this got to be really complicated. maybe I will lease an m3 instead. hah.<br/><br/>so today on boingboing there were some really good links. first off - rachel's friend <a href="http://matthew.onigami.net/">matthew</a> was <a href="http://boingboing.net/2004_03_01_archive.html#107877117041941091">listed</a>. that is pretty cool. <a href="http://www.mobagallery.org/index.html">this</a> museum seems entertaining.  having watched a small amount of bollywood movies - I found <a href="http://www.freeorange.net/archives/2004/Mar/09/top_ten_rules_of_indian_filmmaking.htm">this</a> to be amusing. reality is often replicating <a href="http://customwire.ap.org/dynamic/stories/D/DEAR_ABBY_SIMPSONS?SITE=MIDTN&amp;SECTION=ENTERTAINMENT&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">television</a> - or not.  <a href="http://underground.zork.net/">eep</a></p>
