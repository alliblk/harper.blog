                <p style="clear: both">I was tagged by both <a href="http://eliw.wordpress.com/2009/01/05/seven-things/">Eli White</a> and <a href="http://flinglog.com/text/seven-things/">Brian Fling</a> in this dastardly meme regarding 7 things. I am usually a HUGE fan of all things meme - and kind of regard myself as a <a href="http://fukung.net">certified</a> meme expert. However this whole meme that requires a lot of work - I.E. blogging is something entirely different. I think i actually like it, but i am not entirely sure yet ;).</p>


<p style="clear: both">I do find it hilarious that almost every blog post regarding this seven things starts with a bit of self deprecation and surprise at how this meme stumbled upon innocent them. Well, it did come as a surprise - so I guess i understand.</p>


<p style="clear: both">Well here it goes. Seven things about me:</p>


<p style="clear: both"><strong>One:</strong></p>


<p style="clear: both">I grew up without a TV. When I was quite young (~3) my parents got rid of their TV. I am not completely sure why. I imagine it had something to do with money (the lack of) and priorities being making sure my brother and I were clothed and fed. My parents got their first TV after getting rid of the previous one when I was about 21. My parents used to rent a TV for big events (war, olympics, etc) and my brother and I would watch the TV manically until it was returned to the rental place. We also used to rent a TV and VCR about once or twice a year to watch all the movies we could in the time alloted. Those were awesome times. I currently don't have a TV.</p>


<p style="clear: both"><strong>Two:</strong></p>


<p style="clear: both">I have been paid to YoYo and Juggle in front of a LOT of people. I guess that makes me a professional. Heh. In college my two best buddies (<a href="http://therats.org">Matiss</a> and Brian) and myself started a "circus" group. We juggled and did shows for all sorts of things. We opened for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubus_(band)">Incubus</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Mix_A_Lot">Sir Mix A Lot</a>, and a few other boring bands. We protest juggled as a group called Jugglers against homophobia - protesting people like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Dole">Elizabeth Dole</a> and her homophobic antics. After college I continued to support my friends by juggling on the side. It was a really fun time. I don't juggle as much as i would like, but i still try to make it to conventions and what not. It is a lot of fun.</p>


<p style="clear: both"><strong>Three:</strong></p>


<p style="clear: both">My first computer was an Apple ][c. My dad got it in some trade. My brother and I would build text games in basic. Shortly after that I got in to BBSs. Mostly we called places like <a href="http://www.totse.com/">&amp;totse</a> and downloaded things that would get me in trouble. It was an awesome time. I suggest checking out the <a href="http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/">BBS Documentary</a> to get an idea of how awesome it actually was.</p>


<p style="clear: both"><strong>Four:</strong></p>


<p style="clear: both">I met my lovely wife <a href="http://hiromiusagi.com">Hiromi</a> while in college in iowa. We moved to Chicago together in 2001 to live together as roommates. Eventually, it became clear that our relationship was much more than that. We got married in 2006 and happily live in Chicago. She is awesome.</p>


<p style="clear: both"><strong>Five:</strong></p>


<p style="clear: both">I read a lot. I always have. Growing up without a TV will do that to a person. I read mostly fiction, but will stray to the dark side and read non-fiction every once and awhile. I usually read about an hour before going to bed. It helps calm me down and is a good way for me to get into the sleeping groove. I have recently been into ebooks and use a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FI73MA?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=nata2productions&amp;link_code=as3&amp;camp=211189&amp;creative=373489&amp;creativeASIN=B000FI73MA">Amazon Kindle</a> to read them. I find that I do miss regularly reading paper books, but the convenience of reading ebooks is awesome. I can't wait until the eInk displays and associated readers are smaller, easier to use and cheaper.</p>


<p style="clear: both"><strong>Six:</strong></p>


<p style="clear: both">I love David Bowie. It isn't a love that requires posters and discussion or anything. It is kind of similar to how people who grew up catholic talk about religion. David Bowie has just always been there for me. My first record I picked for myself was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rise_and_Fall_of_Ziggy_Stardust_and_the_Spiders_from_Mars">Ziggy Stardust</a>. My first concert was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_and_Vision_Tour">Bowie's Sound + Vision tour</a>. When I was quite younger, my mom took me to get my hair cut and I brought along my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinth_(film)">Labyrinth</a> LP to show the stylist that I wanted <a href="http://thefanboys.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/david_bowie_labyrinth.jpg">David Bowie hair</a>. I ended up with a rat tail.</p>


<p style="clear: both"><strong>Seven:</strong></p>


<p style="clear: both">Although I always knew I would end up with a Computer Science degree - I fought it as long as I could. In college I studied the history of Catholicism for a couple years before actually jumping into computer science. It was awesome. I ended up concentrating on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giordano_Bruno">Giordano Bruno</a> and the his (untimely) multi-world theory. It was a lot of fun and lead me to have an unnatural interest in the mechanics of theology.</p>

                <p>I am finally recovered from my flash travel/party tour. Being shuttled around the country going to parties is a rough life - let me tell you. It was awesome. I met some great people and saw some really cool stuff. It was really cool how much overlap occurred between the boulder crowd and SXSW. Startup people are fun. I want to run down the events and how they turned out. The first was boulder. <a href="http://www.keepboulderweird.org/">Boulder is a weird place</a>. Seriously. It is strange. The boulder event was at this bar called the Foundry. I am guessing that if it wasn't packed to the gills with tech people from the front range, I would never go there. It was a pretty hilarious venue, however the tech people really filled it out. So it turned out to be a great choice. In boulder there were a lot of cool startups presenting. The one that really caught my eye was <a href="http://socialthing.com">Socialthing</a>. These guys are sweet. They are doing a very simple and elegant solution for the crowded social aggregation space. Although I really like the community features of their direct competitor <a href="http://friendfeed.com">FriendFeed</a>, I like the design and interface of socialthing alot. It is great - and they are sweet guys. There were a fair number of other startups, but unless they have real words in their names - i won't link them. Just kidding, but seriously - there were a fair number of people with startups that plain didn't have the best names. It is a bummer. Especially because the people were so nice and their ideas/technology seemed solid. It is <a href="http://deliberately-different.blogspot.com/2006/02/how-they-named-companies.html">hard to</a> <a href="http://www.salon.com/media/col/shal/1999/11/30/naming/print.html">name a</a> <a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/02/the_name_game.html">company</a>. Anyway - some of the not so awesomely named but awesome technology and problem solution startups in boulder are:</p>

<blockquote><a href="http://Lijit.com">Lijit.com</a> - doing search for your blog. kinda like google site search, but with your social graph built in. Really cool stuff. <a href="http://Villij.com">Villij.com</a> - not my favorite name. The guys are cool and they have some cool ideas about recommendations in the social graph space.</blockquote>


<p>I also met a really awesome "startup enabler" named <a href="http://jeremytanner.com/">Jeremy Tanner</a>. He seems to do what I do at Threadless for various startups in the Colorado scene. Jeremy moved from Detroit to Colorado - so he had a lot of input on how it was going from city to smaller city. He had great things to say about being able to jump on his motorcycle and head to the canyons for an awesome lunch time experience. After this event, I crashed at my hotel. Spent some time with my parents and was off to SXSW for ONE day! With much insanity, I finally made it to Austin and barely made it to the People Powered Powwow. It was awesome. Hearing the experiences of <a href="http://etsy.com">Etsy</a>, <a href="http://www.timbuk2.com/tb2/products/bagbuilder">Timbuk2</a>, <a href="http://moo.com/">Moo</a>, <a href="http://www.jpgmag.com/">JPG</a> and all the other awesome companies was quite inspiring. It was also awesome to meet the people who are behind all these awesome brands. It was like a secret people powered club where we all tell our people powering secrets. A really powerful meetup. I am glad that <a href="http://richardmoross.com/">Richard</a> (from moo) set it up. it alone was worth the trip. Some of the companies that were there that I really liked:</p>

<blockquote><a href="http://styleshake.com/user/">Styleshake</a> - I was surprised by this one. Styleshake is a neat community that helps facilitate custom dresses. Another thing I would have never guessed would be made into a crowd sourcing enterprise - but it works. And it seems to work well. The dresses are cool and the variations are impressive. If I was a svelte young woman I would certainly check this out. <a href="http://www.burdastyle.com/">BurdaStyle</a> - I thought this was the coolest idea i had heard in awhile. Open source sewing patterns. Taking various patterns and releasing the designs to the community to create and manipulate. Helping to foster the crafting, sewing world as well as create awesome clothes.</blockquote>


<p>After the mini conference, I was fortunate enough to have dinner with the JPG people and Wilson Minor (<a href="http://everyblock.com">EveryBlock</a>). We ate at some nice Mexican food place. It was good, better than Chicago Mexican food. Then I made my way to the soon to be <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/430139/">bumping party</a>. The party was fun. There were a lot of people. Floss seemed to be well accepted and it was awesome to meet <a href="http://www.kidkameleon.com/">kid kameleon</a>. Around this time I had the awesomeness to bump into a dude from <a href="http://www.threadbanger.com/">Threadbangers</a>. he was able to capture my <a href="http://www.threadbanger.com/episode/SXSW_20080310">natural retardedness for an episode of threadbangers</a>. haha. Whew. After my debut in amazing, I was able to take a minute and meet up with some friends. It is fun to hang out with Chicago friends when not in Chicago. I met up with <a href="http://jacobdehart.com">Jacob DeHart</a>, <a href="http://bloxes.com/">Aza Raskin</a>, <a href="http://www.srobbin.com/">Scott Robbin</a>, <a href="http://www.humanized.com/about/">Andrew Wilson</a>. Another person I was thrilled to meet up with is <a href="http://mediadiet.net/">Heath Row</a>. Heath has always been a favorite person of mine and it is great (and rare) to hang out in person. After the party died down - we all went to the <a href="http://PureVolume.com">Pure Volume</a> ranch for the Social Thing party and my trip came full circle. I was able to meet up with the Lijit, Villij and Socialthing guys. After rocking out there for a couple hours i decided to head home, sleep and finally attempt to make my way back to Chicago. I barely made it. ;)</p>

                <p>Awhile ago I got this email from a friend. It is about the Medical Marijuana problem with Iraq veterans. I thought you guys might like to read it. So here it is:</p>

<blockquote>I just read the article you posted about medical marijuana and veterans and it definitely was intense. Its a shame that they are not getting taken care of. That particular guy says that there were no nightmares and his limbs were intact, which is very lucky. I have friends that came back from Iraq in the last year or so and it is scary to see the change. First off, only one of them has agreed to come out and interact with us again. My friend John is a Marine and was stationed mainly in Ramadi. John had always been an interesting character, but since Iraq he has lost all innocence. He's still very spontaneous and wacky, but in a very bitter way. He acts as he does because he's so angry that popped collars walk around thinking that they are kings, and John is not treated as a king coming back home. He won't talk about most of what happened over there, only few of the fonder memories. His best friend was basically blown up in front of him, leaving a wife and child in California. One particular weekend, John and I went to CU to visit my now ex. Very stressful nights that weekend. John got shit ass drunk as quickly as possible and yelled at everyone on the streets for being able to enjoy their 20 something years. We got kicked out of two bars in half an hour, then John decided to disappear for the rest of the night. He'd come back in one hour, two hour, three hour intervals and take off again. Talking to him on the ride there and back was ridiculously difficult. Making small talk was pointless, and talking about Iraq was too personal. Every time he came back home he pulled the same disappearing act, completely disregarding the fact that we were worried about him.It just broke my heart to see how badly he wished he was still naive. He was sent to Iraq for a second trip, and I have since lost contact with him or friends that would know where he was. That article totally hit a sore spot in my heart for these guys out there. In no way am I a supporter of the war or the military, but I completely support the individuals that decide to put themselves into the military. This line from the article, 'My wife was the love of my life, the girl I wanted to spend the rest of my life with, but when I came back from Iraq, she was now a complete stranger to me, as I was to her.' is an issue that most vets deal with, its really fucking sad.</blockquote>


<p>Yep. Its insane how the government is creating a state of war that most people don't want, then not supporting the troops as much as they need to be supported. We need this to stop.</p>

He was 84. I read my first Kurt Vonnegut book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Slapstick-Lonesome-More-Kurt-Vonnegut/dp/0385334230/ref=pd_bbs_sr_10/104-8140476-8316711?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1176359408&amp;sr=8-10">Slapstick</a>, &nbsp;when I was in 5th grade. It was really amazing. I was quite a bit young for the book, but it was a great follow up to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Catch-22-Novel-Simon-Schuster-Classics/dp/0684865130/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-8140476-8316711?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1176360307&amp;sr=1-1">Catch-22</a>. hah. I still remember Slapstick and think about it quite often.</p>


<p>~ hi ho ~</p>


<p>I think that is my Favorite Kurt Vonnegut book.</p>


<p>Kurt Vonnegut made quite the impact on me.&nbsp;My father was a big Vonnegut fan and recommended that I read his books constantly. As&nbsp; grew older we were able to share the jokes, and the excitement of Vonnegut's novels. It was a great thing to share with your loved ones. I continue to push Kurt Vonnegut's books on to my friends and family as much as I can. His novels are always quirky and fun. They reminded me that life isn't always serious, even if serious things are happening.&nbsp; The single biggest piece of knowledge I gleaned from his novels was the theme that&nbsp;we need to treat people well. His books were a great commentary on why more humanist values are needed in our world. If anyone is wondering what is wrong with the world, read a bundle of Kurt Vonnegut, a couple Studs Terkel and Joseph Heller's Catch-22. You will be set right.</p>


<p>I once was able to meet and speak a small amount with Kurt Vonnegut when he spoke at a school in the Chicago suburbs. He talked about humanism and being old. He mentioned how he felt a humanist funeral should&nbsp;be. It was very humorous. I took a picture of Kurt Vonnegut and me and gave&nbsp;it to my father.</p>


<p>In regards to death,&nbsp; I feel that Kurt Vonnegut's version of death and afterlife is the closest to my own beliefs on the matter.&nbsp;In Studs Terkel's book&nbsp;"<i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Will-Circle-Unbroken-Reflections-Ballantine/dp/0345451201/ref=pd_bbs_sr_7/104-8140476-8316711?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1176360262&amp;sr=8-7">Will the Circle Be Unbroken? Reflections on Death, Rebirth, and Hunger for a Faith</a>,</i>" Studs interviews Vonnegut on death and Vonnegut <a href="http://speakingoffaith.publicradio.org/programs/studsterkel/vonnegut.shtml">says the following</a>:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>What the freethinkers were are now called humanists. I am one. A humanist believes, because of Darwin, whose truths were so shocking, in making the most use of good science as possible. Humanists behave well without any expectation of either reward or punishment in an afterlife. We serve, as best we can, our community. When I was growing up, nobody ever said anything about Heaven, about an afterlife. They said that this life was enough.</p>
<p>I have experienced what happens when I die, and so have you. We call it sleep.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This is the basis for my beliefs and I feel is pretty much the basis for the humanist movement. You need to do good. right now. because you may not be here soon. and you may not be here tomorrow. and since there is no afterlife, this is the best and there is no waiting for the better to happen. so lets have fun and enjoy what we have!</p>


<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, babies. Welcome to Earth. It&rsquo;s hot in the summer and cold in the winter. It&rsquo;s round and wet and crowded. At the outside, babies, you&rsquo;ve got about a hundred years here. There&rsquo;s only one rule that I know of, babies &mdash; &lsquo;God damn it, you&rsquo;ve got to be kind.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p>- Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. (November 11, 1922 - April 11, 2007)</p>
</blockquote>


<p>So it goes.</p>

                <p>I broke my blog the other day. It was a pain in the ass. I don't really know what happened - just that it broke. So I was thinking, I hate upgrading my wordpress. I hate it. I agree 100% with <a href="http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/upgrading-wordpress/">Matt Cutts</a> about how wordpress has one of the most clunky and cruft creating upgrade process. So annoying. And it gets even more annoying when you are doing it with 50 blogs. stupid friends. hah. So awhile ago I created this script which basically lets me just execute a small number of commands to upgrade a wordpress blog. If a script isn't really your thing, it seems like the best way to handle wordpress upgrades is to use SVN to do them. I am going to look into the best way to do that, but my experience so far in that experiment has shown me that the bleeding edge release of wordpress is not always a working release. ;) <a href="http://photomatt.net/">Matt</a> from wordpress <a href="http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/upgrading-wordpress/#comment-100841">comments</a> on Matt Cutt's blog about the existence of a <a href="http://www.zirona.com/software/wordpress-instant-upgrade/">upgrade plugin</a> - which seems really interesting. hmm.. So anyway. The script... I am warning you that this script HAS KILLED AT LEAST ONE BLOG. hah. but it has also regularly upgraded at least 50 blogs as well. So.. use at your own risk. and feel free to modify and fix stuff that you see. I am assuming that your web layout is:</p>

<blockquote>/ <em>- root of domain</em> /web <em>- blogs webroot</em> /archive <em>- archive for old backups</em></blockquote>


<p>If your layout differs it will not be too hard to change the vars and make the script work for you. The script will backup your wordpress DB, tar up your wordpress dir, download the newest version of wordpress, untar the new wordpress, and then move all your wp-content and what not into the new wordpress dir. It then puts all the backups into a dated folder in the archive dir. then cleans up a bit after itself. The script does not account for any customizations at all. If you have any files that are placed in the webroot, or files that are not in their normal places, it will not work at all. Honestly - unless you know what you are doing and really want to play Russian roulette of the bash kind - I wouldn't use this script. ;)</p>

<blockquote>#!/bin/bash # Dirs webdir="web" archivedir="archive" # Mysql credentials database="wordpress mysql database" username="wordpress mysql username" password="wordpress mysql password" #the meat of the script echo "Wordpress upgrade script" echo "* Backing up wordpress db" /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqldump $database -u $username -p$password &gt; sql_backup_`date +"%m-%d-%Y"`.sql echo "* Gzipping wordpress sql" gzip sql_backup_`date +"%m-%d-%Y"`.sql mkdir wordpress.backup_`date +"%m-%d-%Y"` mv sql_backup_`date +"%m-%d-%Y"`.sql.gz wordpress.backup_`date +"%m-%d-%Y"` mkdir wp-backup_`date +"%m-%d-%Y"` cd $webdir echo "* Backing up the old wordpress" tar zcf ../wordpress.backup_`date +"%m-%d-%Y"`/$webdir.backup_`date +"%m-%d-%Y-%T"`.tgz . cp -a wp-config.php ../wp-backup_`date +"%m-%d-%Y"` cp -a wp-content ../wp-backup_`date +"%m-%d-%Y"` cp -a wp-images ../wp-backup_`date +"%m-%d-%Y"` cp -a .htaccess ../wp-backup_`date +"%m-%d-%Y"` cd ../wp-backup_`date +"%m-%d-%Y"` echo "* Downloading the newest wordpress" wget -q http://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz echo "* Extrating the new wordpress" tar zxf latest.tar.gz cd .. echo "* Doing a bunch of directory and file juggling" mv $webdir wordpress.backup_`date +"%m-%d-%Y"`/ mv wordpress.backup_`date +"%m-%d-%Y"`/ $archivedir/wordpress.backup_`date +"%m-%d-%Y-%T"` mv wp-backup_`date +"%m-%d-%Y"`/wordpress $webdir cp -af wp-backup_`date +"%m-%d-%Y"`/* $webdir/ cp -af wp-backup_`date +"%m-%d-%Y"`/.htaccess $webdir/ echo "* Cleaning up" rm -rf wp-backup_`date +"%m-%d-%Y"`/ echo "* Backup placed in $archivedir/wordpress.backup_`date +"%m-%d-%Y-%T"`" echo "All upgraded. Run the upgrade script: /wp-admin/upgrade.php"</blockquote>


<p>So you drop this script into your domain root and then execute it. Here is the output from my most recent upgrade.</p>

<blockquote>[jhr@destrukt nata2.org]$ sh wordress_upgrade.sh Wordpress upgrade script * Backing up wordpress db * Gzipping wordpress sql * Backing up the old wordpress * Downloading the newest wordpress * Extrating the new wordpress * Doing a bunch of directory and file juggling * Cleaning up * Backup placed in archive/wordpress.backup_03-31-2007-17:50:04 All upgraded. Run the upgrade script: /wp-admin/upgrade.php [jhr@destrukt nata2.org]$</blockquote>


<p>Since it completely removes all the old files, except those in wp-content and wp-images it leads to less cruft and nonsense. It simply runs though and does what I would have done with my fingers, but automagically. You can <a href="http://stuff.harperreed.org/v/code/wordpress_upgrader/f/wordress_upgrade-release.sh">download the script at stuff.harperreed.org</a>. So there yea go. Its really simple and quite easy. And it works great for upgrading my blogs. Let me know if it worked for you, or if you have any comments or suggestions.</p>

                <p>So at lunch today we were talking about vegan food and I remembered this excellent vegan chocolate cake recipe that my family made for the holidays. It is so good. I remember when we had bunches of non-vegan cakes and pies - this one was always the first to get eaten (the majority of my family is not vegan). Soo good. Anyway - here is the recipe - straight from my mom:</p>

<blockquote><strong>Chocolate Vegan Cake</strong> Ingredients:
<ul>
<li>1 1/2 cup flour</li>
<li>1/3 cup cocoa powder</li>
<li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1 cup sugar</li>
<li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
<li>1 cup cold water</li>
<li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
<li>2 teaspoon vinegar</li>
</ul>
Directions: Preheat oven 375 degrees. Use small brownie sized pan, (no greasing required.) Mix all dry ingredients right in pan. Mix all wet ingredients in a separate bowl EXCEPT VINEGAR, (IMPORTANT.) Add wet ingredients to dry and stir until all dry ingredients are mixed. Add vinegar quickly and stir in</blockquote>

            <div class="PostContent">
                <p>So there has always had a problem with US mobile providers having their voicemail be susceptible to being compromised by calling with a spoofed caller id. Apparently most providers caller id apps just checks the referring callerid - and doesn't force the voicemail user to pick a passcode; so it allows someone to trick the voicemail app into believing they are calling from a trusted number. This has been covered all <a href="http://www.toast442.org/C662738431/E680925937/index.html">over the</a> <a href="http://www.i-hacked.com/content/view/124/47">Internet</a> and was in the <a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2005/01/01/paris.html">spotlight</a> awhile back when it was alleged that this was how <a href="http://blog.tmcnet.com/blog/tom-keating/mobile-phones/paris-hilton-hacks-voicemail-using-asterisk.asp">Paris Hilton's mobile phone was hacked</a>. It is a pretty big problem and is probably really easy to fix. So, just to make things funnier - I decided that I would release a snippit of code that would make it easier to execute this hack.</p>

<blockquote>#!/asterisk/php/bin/php -q &lt;? set_time_limit(30); //make sure the php script doesn't time out require('phpagi.php'); // include the phpagi class error_reporting(E_ALL); // limit the errors $agi = new AGI(); // instantiate the AGI class $agi-&gt;answer(); // answer the phone sleep(2); // wait a sec or two $agi-&gt;stream_file('enter_spoof'); // speak a wav file that says "enter the number" $result = $agi-&gt;get_data('beep', 3000, 10); // beep and grab the 10 numbers $agi-&gt;verbose("Number to call:".$result['result']); // throw info so you know whats up $agi-&gt;set_callerid($result['result']); // set caller id to the number you are calling $agi-&gt;exec("Dial IAX2/iax-provider/1".$result['result']); // call the number ?&gt;</blockquote>


<p>You can add this to your /var/lib/asterisk/agi-bin dir and then specify the extension you want to use to dial and execute the php/agi script</p>

<blockquote>exten =&gt; 666,1,Answer exten =&gt; 666,2,AGI(tmobilevoicemail_spoof.php) exten =&gt; 666,3,Hangup</blockquote>


<p>Then when you dial 666 it executes the script. It will ask you what number to dial then dial it after setting the caller id to the same number. It will dial the number and then ring the phone. If the phone is on and the target number is answered - it won't work; however if the person doesn't answer you will be placed in the targets voicemail as a trusted user. So, I would suggest calling people in the middle of the night or when you know they will not answer. Wait.. I actually wouldn't suggest calling anyone but yourself. It seems to me that the only viable solution that will be compatible with all phones, people and providers is to force the users to choose passcode to your voicemail. This is - of course - a proof of concept. You should not actually hack peoples voicemails. That is not very nice. We are into being nice. Also, check out my <a href="http://www.nata2.org/2006/02/14/caller-id-spoofing-with-php-and-asterisk/">previous entry on caller id spoofing</a>.</p>

<p align="left">So now that everyone is finally interested in getting a symbian phone - i decided to unearth some tricks and what not for symbian phones.</p>
<div align="left">
<p align="left">I have tried most of these. I am not quite sure where i got this list - probably from some yahoo group or some site years ago when i got my 7610. Most of it works on my N70 so it should all be still current.</p>

<div style="text-align: center"><!--adsense--></div>
<strong>Tip 1 - Do you know how to use the edit button (abc or pencil button)?</strong> Heres how... in the inbox for example; you wanna delete multiple SMS, simply hold the edit button, scroll down, and then, press c to delete the marked SMS. The edit button can also be used to copy and past text in SMS, simply hold it and scroll across, choose copy. <strong>Tip 2 - How to reset your password</strong> Press *#7370#, then enter the lock code, which is the sec code of the phone. NOTE: battery must be full, else if format is disrupted by low battery, consequences will be disastrous for 6600 users, to format the phone, theres an alternative way. Press and hold &lt;3&gt;, &lt;*&gt;, and the buttons, then power on phone, keep holding on the 3 buttons, till you come to a format screen. this method ONLY works on 6600, and need not enter the sec code. BUT sec code won't be reset to default 12345. <strong>Tip 3 - installing .sis files simply using the cable</strong> Just plug it in, place the .sis file anywhere on e: (the MMC), not in any folders, root of e:, disconnect, then look for it in manager. <strong>Tip 4 &ndash; Task Menu</strong> Save on battery and system memory being used by regularly checking the task manager which can be accessed by holding down the menu button!! <strong>Tip 4a</strong> - Set the screen saver to a short time out period to prolong battery life. <strong>Tip 4b</strong> - Avoid restarting the phone, or repeatedly turning it on and off. This helps increase battery life. <strong>Tip 5 &ndash; IMEI Number</strong> Type *#06# to display your IMEI serial number, very valuable for the unlocking your phone to other sim cards <strong>Tip 6 &ndash; Firmware Version</strong> Type *#0000# to view which firmware version you are running <strong>Tip 7 &ndash; Avoid being bluejacked</strong> If you would like to avoid being "blue jacked", keep bluetooth turned off, or set your phone's visibility to hidden. <strong>Tip 8 - Make your phone a watch</strong> Don't want to carry a watch and a phone? Set the screen saver to show date and time, then you can ditch the watch. <strong>Tip 9 &ndash; Save memory while installing apps</strong> Save memory when installing apps, by installing over bluetooth. This can be done using the nokia phone suite and a bluetooth serial connection. Only works with .SIS files, so java still has to be sent to the phone, but will save space when using .SIS files. <strong>Tip 10 - Operator logos</strong> Use a filemanager like FExplorer or SeleQ to add the folders: "c:/system/Apps/phone/oplogo". Add a .bmp picture to folder "oplogo" and restart your phone! The .bmp picture size needs to be: 97 x 25 pixels <strong>Tip 11 - Check if the recipients phone is on</strong> Delivery reports or Type *0# your message in the message composer window space then write your message, the recipient will not see the star zero hash bit - just the message When they read it it will relay a message back to your phone showing the time they received it. (haven't yet tried it myself though) <strong>Tip 12 - BlueJacking</strong> First up, you need to know what Bluetooth is. There are lots of types of modern devices that incorporate Bluetooth as one of their many features. PDAs, mobile phones and laptops are a few of these modern devices. Bluetooth means that Bluetooth enabled devices can send things like phonebook/address book contacts, pictures &amp; notes to other Bluetooth enabled devices wirelessly over a range of about 10 metres. So, we've got past the boring part. Now, using a phone with Bluetooth, you can create a phonebook contact and write a message, eg. 'Hello, you've been bluejacked', in the 'Name' field. Then you can search for other phones with Bluetooth and send that phonebook contact to them. On their phone, a message will popup saying "'Hello, you've been bluejacked' has just been received by Bluetooth" or something along those lines. For most 'victims' they will have no idea as to how the message appeared on their phone. <strong>Tip 13: Gallery Shortcut Keys</strong> While you are viewing a picture in your phone's gallery, press one of these shortcut keys (definitely works on 6600, not sure about other symbians) 1 - turn image anticlockwise 3 - turn image clockwise * - toggle on/off of full screen 5 - zoom in 0 - zoom out <strong>Tip 16: A soft and Hard reset</strong> A Soft-reset - the process of resetting all the settings of the phone to the factory default! No applications are deleted! A Hard-reset is like formatting a drive! It does format the memory. Everything that has been installed after the first use of the phone is deleted! It will recover the memory of the phone to the state you purchased it! It is done by inputing the following code: *#7370# NOTE: The battery must be full or the charger has to be connected to the phone so that it does not run out of power and make the phone unusable. <strong>Tip 17: Formats of images</strong> supported ones: JPG UPF GIF87a/89a WBMB MBM TIFF/F PNG EXIF How to copy &amp; paste text in your Nokia 3650: Press and hold the pencil key and select your text using the scroll key. Left function key will change to 'Copy'. Press it to copy the selected text to clipboard. You can paste the clipboard contents the same way: press and hold the pencil key and press 'Paste'. Or, press pencil key once and select 'Paste'. Press and hold the Menu key to open the application switching window, where you can *duh* switch between applications. <strong>Tip 18: Hanging Program</strong> If a program hangs and you can't shut it down, select the application in the application switching window and press 'C' to kill it. It's also a faster way to exit programs. <strong>Tip 19: Quiet your camera shutter</strong> Turn on/off the "click" sound made by the camera by selecting the 'Silent' profile or by turning warning tones on/off: Menu &gt; Profiles &gt; "select your activated profile" &gt; Personalize &gt; Warning tones &gt; On/Off. (This also effects the sound of Java games and apps).

<strong>Tip 20: Background Image</strong> To change background image go to: Menu &gt; Tools &gt; Settings &gt; Phone &gt; Standby mode &gt; Background image &gt; Yes &gt; "choose an image". The best size for background images is 174x132 pixels.<strong>Tip 21: Contact Image</strong> Display an image when someone's calling: Menu &gt; Contacts &gt; "select a contact card" &gt; Options &gt; Edit &gt; Options &gt; Add thumbnail &gt; "choose an image". <strong>Tip 22: Contact Ringtone</strong> Add a personal ringing tone to a contact: Menu &gt; Contacts &gt; "select a contact card" &gt; Options &gt; Open &gt; Options &gt; Ringing tone &gt; "choose a ringing tone". <strong>Tip 23: Delete all messages in your inbox</strong> Delete all messages from your Inbox at once: Menu &gt; Messaging &gt; Inbox &gt; Options &gt; Mark/Unmark &gt; Mark all &gt; Options &gt; Delete. <strong>Tip 24: Hide Caller ID</strong> Send or hide your caller ID: Go to: Menu &gt; Tools &gt; Settings &gt; Call &gt; Send My Caller ID &gt; 'Yes', 'No' or 'Set By Network' to follow the default settings of your home network. <strong>Tip 25: Copying large files?</strong> If you often copy large files to your MultiMedia Card, I recommend a card reader. <em>E.g.</em> With a card reader it takes only 12 seconds to copy a 10 MB file! <strong>Tip 26: Record a phone call</strong> Record the sound of a phone call using the (sound) Recorder. Menu &gt; Extra's &gt; Recorder &gt; Options &gt; Record sound clip. Note: short beeps are audible during call registration. But there is a 60 second limitation so if you want unlimited sound recording get this app: Extended Recorder. <strong>Tip 27: Switch dictionary On/Off</strong> While writing text, press "#" to switch between upper and lower case and Dictionary on/off (predictive text input). <strong>Tip 30: Switch between alpha and numeric mode</strong> Press and hold "#" to switch between Alpha mode and Number mode. <strong>Tip 31: Keyboard shortcuts for zooming and rotating images in Images:</strong> 1 = zoom in 0 = zoom out, press and hold to return to the normal view 2 = rotate anticlockwise 9 = rotate clockwise * = full screen In standby mode, press and hold the right soft key to activate voice dialing. <strong>Tip 32: Add a voice tag</strong> To add a voice tag to a phone number, open a contact card and scroll to the phone number and select: Options &gt; Add voice tag. <strong>Tip 33: Customize soft keys</strong> You can customize both soft keys located below the screen (in standby mode): Menu &gt; Tools &gt; Settings &gt; Phone &gt; Standby mode &gt; Left/Right selection key &gt; "select an application". <strong>Tip 34: Standby Mode -&gt; Contacts</strong> In standby mode. press scroll key center (joystick) to go directly to Contacts. <strong>Tip 35: Standby Mode -&gt; WAP Home Page</strong> In standby mode, press and hold 0 to launch your wap home page. <strong>Tip 36: Launch a specific application based on space</strong> In Menu or any subfolder, press numbers 1 - 9 to start the application at that location. 123 456 789 <strong>Tip 37: Dial a specific number</strong> In standby mode, 45# + dials the number on your sim in memory slot 45. 50# + dials slot 50 and so on. <strong>Tip 38: Turn on back light while keypad is locked</strong> If you have your keylock activated just press the on/off button to turn on your backlight to look at the time when it's dark without having to unlock the keypad.

                <p>I have cleaned up and commented a little hack i did for my home asterisk server - allowing a person to dial an extension and then be walked through spoofing caller id on a call. It is a ridiculously easy hack to engage. I was surprised and a bit concerned at what this means in regards to trust and telephony. I mean, if a hobbyist is able to spoof caller id on a phone call to anywhere with nothing more than <a href="http://asteriskathome.sourceforge.net/">asterisk@home</a> and <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/server/">vmware</a>.. what is to stop someone from setting something like this up and stealing credit cards or social security numbers using some crazy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_%28computer_security%29">social engineering</a>.. i guess nothing.. So anyway, i released <a href="http://asteriskathome.sourceforge.net/">my source code</a>. It is really really simple and based entirely on one small block of code. The basic idea is:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><small>Prompt user for input (spoofed number)</small></li>
<li><small>Grab 10 digits (spoofed number)</small></li>
<li><small>Prompt user for input (number to call)</small></li>
<li><small>Grab 10 digits (number to call)</small></li>
<li><small>Set caller idea based on input in step 1 and 2</small></li>
<li><small>Make call to number from input in step 3 and 4</small></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>


<p>As you can see the idea is pretty simple. get input. set callerid. make call. The code is just as simple:</p>

<blockquote><small><span style="font-style: italic">//(step 1) Prompt user for input</span> $agi-&gt;stream_file('enter_spoof'); <span style="font-style: italic">//(step 2) Grab 10 digits</span> $result = $agi-&gt;get_data('beep', 3000, 10); <span style="font-style: italic">//set variables and output debug info</span> $spoofnumber= $result['result']; $agi-&gt;verbose("Spoof Number:".$spoofnumber);</small> <small><span style="font-style: italic">//(step 3) Prompt user for input</span> $agi-&gt;stream_file('call_spoof'); <span style="font-style: italic">//(step 4) Grab 10 digits</span> $result = $agi-&gt;get_data('beep', 3000, 10); <span style="font-style: italic">//set variables and output debug info</span> $callnumber= $result['result']; $agi-&gt;verbose("Number to call:".$callnumber); <span style="font-style: italic">//(step 5) Set callerid to whatever the input was in step 2</span> $agi-&gt;set_callerid($spoofnumber); <span style="font-style: italic">//(step 6) Make call to number from input in step 3 and 4 $agi-&gt;exec("Dial IAX2/yourpassword@provider/1".$callnumber);</span></small></blockquote>


<p>The agi interface to asterisk obviously hides a lot of the complex stuff that asterisk does in the background - but still - the code is insanely simple. even with user interaction. A lot of features could be added - password; callerid checking to make sure only valid users are using the app; call back - so if you call it and set up your spoof, it calls back your number to make sure you who you say you are. or whatever ;) a lot of options are available. With a little bit of expansion - i think someone could easily make a robust callerid spoofing application for criminals and not criminals. it is easy enough for anyone to do. Check out my code here: <a href="http://stuff.harperreed.org/?path=code%2Fasterisk_callerspoof_php&amp;text=asterisk_callerspoof.phps">asterisk_callerspoof</a> What i have done is nothing new - there is a great article about all this: <a href="http://www.rootsecure.net/?p=reports/callerid_spoofing">Automated Caller ID / ANI Spoofing</a> asterisk and php rule.</p>

                <p>So. I have been at work a lot lately. So my amp mod is pretty dope. Although i get a fierce hum when i charge the battery - i have decided to move forward and build the rest of it. I think i am going to build four distinct parts. First the power supply. i am thinking that the power supply should be completely separate from all of the other components - mostly cuz it is totally noise causing and i will be able to replace it if needed. I do like how clean and portable the battery power is - so i will keep that and then make the trickle charger just charge it always. I would like to place a digital or analog voltage meter on the front to make sure that the voltage is correct and that the battery is charged. I think something real flashy wil be nice. like a simple digital display with a blue LED backlight. It will rule. The second component will be the preamp/input switch - this will be a simple simple preamp. The tirck will be that the volume pot will be motorized to control the volume via a microcontroller - this will allow me to have a remote. god i need a remote. then i will also add twin VU meters - not real real vu meters, but somethign that will allow me to view the levels for each channel. once again - something kinda flashy. i think that really nice analog VUish meters woudl be nice - with that really dim seventies light. Something simple though. The third component would be the phono preamp. It would a really chilled out active/passive phono preamp that would allow me to hook my turntable(1200 w00t) to my preamp/amp. that is all. The fourth and probable most important part of the equation would be the amp. i would take the pot off the amp and make it just be an amp. nothing more. i will possibly use the sonic impact t-amp - but maybe upgrade to something with a bit power so i don't have to use crazy crazy speakers for it to soudn good. A probably pseudo parts list:</p>

<p>I think that this project rules and is totally teaching me more about electronics. i mean - i took the classes and have done shit with microcontrollers - but i like this application crap. it rules. so there.</p>

                <p>i had these pictures forever - but I was unable to put them up. first I thought I lost my camera battery. then I found it. then I was dumb. then dumber. then I figured it all out. for the record. iphoto is not better than picasa. picasa is real real nice. the absolute integration of iphoto is dope. but picasa is better. a lot better. heh.</p>


<p>so here are some pictures from awhile ago:</p>

<br>


<p>also check out <a href="http://43things.com">43 things</a> - a really really cool idea. I think I will integrate it with my new blog design. I also want to make a friends section like nick whatever's blog - which I don't want to find right now. I need to rethink my design a bit. but I am happy so far. to load peoples rss I am thinking about using xmlhttp or something. it should rule.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i am also thinking about combining <a href="http://www.tiddlywiki.com/">tiddywiki</a> and xmlhttp to create a super fancy smooth javascript notepad for my site. it should rule.<br></p>

<br>


<p>also check out my friend kevi's site: <a href="http://www.slimkevi.com/">slimkevi</a>. he is trying to lose a bunch of weight. the site is totally awesome. good luck. I hope he finds himself successful.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i am reading these insane fantasy novels that matiss lent me. I don't usually like fantasy nobels - however these are incredible. they are called the "vlad taltos" books - the first being called "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0441385540/">jhereg</a>". they totally rule. I sometimes hate fantasy genre - but these are incredible. haha. I love dragons. and all that.<br></p>

<br>


<p>in other news - I am almost completing done with my site for work. this rules. however, it just means that I get to work hard on stuff like my dads site and howtoyoyo. its gunna be good.</p>

It was stupid, those are such scams. it took a long time - cuz i didn&#8217;t really care. but seriously. it isn&#8217;t worth doing. you might as well just save your money and buy one. odn&#8217;t get me wrong - it is free. but you are inadvertently selling out your fiends in the process. ;)</p>


<p>I also picked up a mac mini. i really like the form factor and the design. the OS is nice. however i decided that i really hate macs. basically i have been a pc user my whole life. i use linux and have used every version of windows. i don&#8217;t enjoy windows - however it is what i know. so i get this mac mini and i plugit in and play with it and what not and i immediately feel the limitations of the OS. not like it is limiting me - but that my expectations of being fucked with are limiting my view of what i can do with it. It just seemed too easy - like it was a trick. i really felt as though macs are the padded rooms of the computing world. as hard as i tried i couldn&#8217;t hurt myself while i was playing with a mac - not to say i was unable to - just that i was not able to with ease. not like a windows machine. a windows machine - i could completely fuck up in an hour of regular usage; however a mac i was unable to break or cuz even the slightest of pains after hours and hours of playign with, tweaking, etc. it was almost annoying. it rendered my computer time into something boring. i had time to go outside and wade into snow. LAME. however i do enjoy the smoothness of the interface and i haven&#8217;t disconnected it. what i really need to do is install a debian on my pc and get a kvm. or not a kvm. i guess i would have ip access - so i could just use X. hmm. i wish windows was as cool.</p>

<br>


<p>today I shoudl get my mac mini. so I planned for its arrival. I brought a fancy knife that I use to open things like apple computers, I brought a couple dual headed screwdrivers. and I brought a camera. I am ready t welcome the little guy into the new world. this has brought me to start thinking how silly the things I carry on my person are. so I decided that I woudl catalog everything that I carry on my person on the way to work. here it is:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><small>clothes (of course)</small></li>
<li><small>wallet</small></li>
<li><small>keys to my apartment</small></li>
<li><small>nokia 7610 phone</small></li>
<li><small>moonboots</small></li>
<li><small>hoody</small></li>
<li><small>glasses</small></li>
<li><small>burts beeswax</small></li>
<li><small>ipod mini</small></li>
<li><small>shure e2c headphones</small></li>
<li><small>richard ford - independence day</small></li>
<li><small>mini screw driver</small></li>
<li><small>regular sized screw driver</small></li>
<li><small>custom <a href="http://www.knifecenter.com/kc_new/store_detail.html?s=QN45EO">big chief knife</a> (customized by my brother while he was in dive school)</small></li>
<li><small>work pager</small></li>
<li><small>key card</small></li>
<li><small>work laptop</small></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>


<p>So yea. that is what I carried to work. I don't carry a bag or anything. I just stuff my pockets. I probably look like a dork. but who cares.<br></p>

<br>


<p>so I am going to throw out their a smallish gripe. ever since I got the 7610 I have been really happy with my phone - however. it is a pain in the ass to upload pictures. because the pictures are ~1mp so they are a lot larger than I am used to. but it will take a good 15-20 minutes to upload a few pictures. sooooo annoying.<br></p>

<br>


<p>if it was faster I would be posting pictures of my fancy new mac mini that came while writing this post ;).</p>

                <p>i haven't really been blogging like I should. eh.. I get annoyed with it. so I don't do it. and then my friends and family contact me and yell. haha. so then I start again. heh. a "never ending" cycle of horror. heh. eh.. it isn't so bad. I don't really mind it. I just haven't had all the extra time in the world. only about half of all the extra time.<br></p>

<br>


<p>speaking of extra time. I have basically just watched movies for the past 4 days. I watched: 2010 space odyssy, return of the king, total recall, anchor man, the man with two brains, the toy, close encounters of the third kind and dusk til dawn. seriously I don't have any free time. haha.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i also spent quite a bit of time programming my microcontroller learning kit. hah. I picked up a basic stamp 2 <a href="http://www.parallax.com/detail.asp?product_id=28158">homework board</a> and a bunch of LEDs from radio shack. I made a couple neat things. basically just experimented with the board and programming in basic to control stuff. I forgot how to do electronics - but it is all coming back to me. I think I am going to get a <a href="http://www.parallax.com/javelin/index.asp">javelin</a> stamp next. ahh.. java. I am hopeing to be able to do some amount of threading - but I have no idea. I think I might be better off with <a href="http://www.reflections.co.nz/micro/GettingStarted/PIC-Getting-started.htm">pic microcontrollers</a> and programming in assembly. I will have to "experiment." luckily there is a multitude of <a href="http://www.emanator.demon.co.uk/bigclive/makendo.htm">things to make and do</a>. now if I coudl only get funding.<br></p>

<br>


<p>lately I have also been working on making a couple sites that have been in the back of my mind for the last month. I have almost completed them . I wish them all to be done. DONE. I say. you shoudl check some of them out soon. hahah. not now though.<br></p>

<br>


<p>tv on the radio is a good band currently.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i should get back to doing real work. haha.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i had so much more to say.. but I forgot.<br></p>

<br>


<p>ohoh. house of flying daggers is an incredible movie. very very good.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i am hungry.</p>

                <p>so I have been reading the rabbit series of books by john updike. they are pretty good. I started with "rabbit redux" and just finished "rabbit, run" last night. after I finished "rabbit, run" I immediately started "rabbit is rich." anyway. I have been thinking about rabbit and what I like/dislike about him in these books. well I don't really like him in "rabbit, run" - I think he is obviously the anti-hero, a destroyer; however I do like him in "rabbit redux." he seems like things are happening to him and he is reacting - reacting strangely - but still reacting; whereas in "rabbit, run," rabbit is being a punk. he makes me mad. which I enjoy.<br></p>

<p>i need to do work.</p>

<br>


<p>last night all I did was play video games. I played <a href="http://www.chroniclogic.com/gish/">gish</a> for about an hour - it is a lot of fun. I enjoyed the motif quite a bit. I do wish it really looked like the still graphics look. I mean I is close - but it coudl be really awesome. it reminds me of the graphics from my favorite tv show ever: <a href="http://www.tvtome.com/InvaderZIM/">invader</a> <a href="http://www.nick.com/all_nick/tv_supersites/zim/">zim</a>. and then I played <a href="http://www.chroniclogic.com/index.htm?bridgeit.htm">Bridge It</a> for about 45 minutes. so much fun. I love physics. haha. basically it allows you the constructor to build bridges of your wildest dreams. and then drive things across them. I made some crazy bridges - I tell you what. after that little stint as a god I joined my roommates for a quick two games of <a href="http://cube.ign.com/articles/570/570749p1.html">mario party six</a>. it ruled.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i love css. and metal. I love metal more than I love css.<br></p>

<br>


<p>this morning sucked. I basically ran around frnatically looking for my winter earrings. I have a pair of amber earrings that my friend mary got me - they are really cool and fit perfectly. however, I apparently lost them and all I can find are these other amber earrings that don't fit. it sucked. both because I really like having them (memories and all that jazz) and because they don't get cold like the blistering metal that is currently inhabiting the nation that is my ear lobes.<br></p>

<br>


<p>now I am off to do work and read comics. and by comics I mean connect to a sql server db and write jsp code.</p>

                <p>on where I left off just a second ago.<br></p>

<br>


<p>so anyawy. this weekend was a lot of fun. I did a little bit of christmas shopping - got soem gift0rs for my peeps and my family. stupid money. why is all this shit so expensive. I would elaborate - but that might give away some of the oh so secret secrets I have. and their are many. so many it hurts inside.<br></p>

<br>


<p>this weekend I did a lot of random develpment. I played a bunch with my new website: <a href="http://www.weatherisawesome.com">weatherisawesome</a>. I am really annoyed with the weather service though. they are pissing me off with piss poor xml. it is just not easy as it could be. and it could be so so elagant. I basically spent most of yesterday evening pissed as hell at the bastards. omg I was mad. then I cleaned my room (it is now pristene), and then made an xslt that rendered part of the xml (the good part). my guess is that they either have some fancy tricks up their sleeve or they are using some standard that was made years ago and just haven't fixed/upgraded it. because it suxors bad. I am gunna punch them. I have thought about super stalking one of the developers and calling them and being like "hey why did you do it this way" and if they respond well - then askingthem for help. yea know. the usual thing.<br></p>

<br>


<p>in other news - soap rules. I am thinking about writing a location soap server that would return either the zip code from lat/long, or the lat/long from zip or finally, zip codes near a certain zaip code. this could help with some fun locaiton apps. like saying - I am here what is near. and the like.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i am also hopeing to do some work with soap and itunesblogger. like making it submit via a soap client or whatever. or maybe have it look to ituneshacking to grab the most listened to songs. it could be really cool.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i love computers - although yesterday I was swearing at every computer ever made.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i feel empty and hollow inside.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i am reading the rabbit books by john updike. they are sad. but the sad that I like. where the characters are seemingly dealing with mediocrity in the way they only know how to. it is nice to read. I just finished rabbit redux and am starting rabbit run today and should be on rabbit is rich in a couple days. I like updickes style - although it is sometimes very very dense and I have to shake my head back and forth to deal with the desity of the descriptions. I love books.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i wish I had a whatiamreadingBlogger program. maybe I will write one. something that hooks into that site - umm - <a href="http://www.allconsuming.net/">allconsuming.net</a> and allows a person to easily and quickly update their reading list. I found that the site - althugh cool - was slow and clunky. which really made it annoying for me.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i find it humourous how I am attempting to "desktop clientize" all of my favorite websites. but they are super thin clients. super super thin. like my fancy pants.<br></p>

<br>


<p>ook. I need sleep. and I am at work. so I am stuck working. and not sleeping. I wish I could pause the day and sleep. omg I would age fast. I would pause it and sleep and sleep and sleep - and then unpause it. I woudl then inadvertently live like 3 days for everyone elses one day. I need to read more time travel books.</p>

                <p>i was playing around with my blog software and I noticed something pretty cool. I have taken over 1000 pictures with my nokia cell phone cam and have roughly 2525 pictures total in my photolog. I have taken pictures of a bunch of neat stuff. it is pretty cool. I have wanted to make a view that is the text from the blog and the pictures all in one fancy view. but I haven't. maybe soon. haha.<br></p>

<br>


<p>today I received my free ipod mini. wtf. so apparently it works. I really don't know what to do with it. I guess use it. I feel weird getting a free thing this expensive. but I guess shit like this happens all the time. heh. I also picked up the best invention in the world: the <a href="http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/081220042347/Nokia6600(029).jpg">tvB-gone</a>. basically it turns off all the tvs in its immediate view by sending out the commonly known IR off signals for north american tvs. it rules. all yesterday I was playing around at stores - turning off banks of tvs. it ruled.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i am attempting to pound out this site I am working on. it is kinda a pain. but whatever. I will finish er off. tonight is the first night I awhile I have been up past 1am. and I am not actually up past 1 yet. haha. I hope I don't screw this up. ;)<br></p>

<br>


<p><a href="http://www.nbc4i.com/news/3983630/detail.html">this</a> is absolutely insane.</p>

<blockquote><small>"Two members of the heavy metal band Damageplan were reportedly shot and killed, including Dimebag Darrell, formerly with the band Pantera, NBC 4's David Wayne reported. The other band member's name was not released. The alleged gunman also died at the scene, Wayne reported."</small></blockquote>


<p>woah. wtf. metal is getting out of hand. the people who listen to it are mentally unstable. it is absolutely true.<br></p>

<br>


<p>in other news - I saw cradle of filth last night. they sucked. well not sucked like were horrible - just not as good as <a href="http://www.the-gothicworld.de/cdreviews/09-2003/dimmu-borgir.jpg">dimmu borgir</a>. also - it appears that <a href="http://cof.rockmetal.art.pl/images/galeria/1.jpg">danny filth</a> has an unreasonably <a href="http://cof.rockmetal.art.pl/images/galeria/13.jpg">large head</a>. it was nuts. he runs out on stage - and I was like - wtf. and I laughed. and then lost interest. however I gained interest in a band called <a href="http://www.trustkill.com/multimedia/videos/bleeding_hail.html">bleeding through</a>. not really anything new. but good energy. and there is a pretty girl playing keyboard. haha. what a dumb metal guy thing to say. silly silly.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i think I am going to get a <a href="http://www.stripper-faq.org/">new job</a>. oh wait I am not a hot girl. so I guess I am not going to. but if I become a hot girl. hells yea. speaking of hot ladies - lately I have been playing with OS X a lot. it rules. so so so smooth. I like it. basically I just ssh into it and play how I like. none of that monitor nonsense. just shell all the way. I love it.<br></p>

<br>


<p>&lt;3<br></p>

<br>


<p>i am going to open my ipod now.</p>

I love working. especially if I am doing exciting things. one of the exciting things I did was put a <a href="http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/031220042255/Nokia6600(964).jpg">huge picture</a> of my cousins cow on my wall. it rules. I used the <a href="http://homokaasu.org/rasterbator/">rasterbator</a>. yall should check it out.<br></p>

                <p>this weekend was pretty fun. I hung out with the fam. yea know the drill. I apparently let my parents car out of the closet. stupid cars. hiding ALL THE TIME. <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A11%3A22_fake_thanksgiving">here be</a> pictures.<br></p>

<br>


<p>some interesting things are happening. it is fn. and not quite expected. but really nice. we shall see how they pan out. I want my <a href="http://www.freeipods.com/default.aspx?referer=6836892">free ipod</a>. I guess I will have to wait months and months for it to arrive. I will just have to start on my <a href="http://www.FreeFlatScreens.com/?r=12211878">free flatscreen</a>. these sites are so stupid. whatever.</p>

                <p>work is awesome again. on friday I did a bunch of stuff getting acclimated with flash and such. kinda fun. then I got bored and wne to drop off some cds to my "boss." he was in his office with this dude listening to music. they were listening to death from above 1979. so I hung out and we all talked about death metal for about 40 minutes. totally awesome. I love it.<br></p>

<br>


<p>then me and some friends went to hard rock hotel. then we went to old timers. then rainbo. then empty bottle. then I was tired and drunk. so I went home. heh. and passed out until 3am at which time I packed for colorado. then I flew to colorado. then I was tired again. hah. so I took a nap. went to lunch with the fam. then took a nap again. now I have slept all day. and am starting to feel normal.<br></p>

<br>


<p>it is snowing here and is quite pretty.<br></p>

<br>


<p>some very interesting things are happening in my life. totally changing everything.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i just heard a cat meowing so I opened the closet and let my parents car out. hah. silly kitty. during my first nap I had a really weird dream about a cat who was hurt. and as the dream progressed. the cat got more and more human like. until in the end it was a human cat hybrid. and totally hot. hahaha.<br></p>

<br>


<p>my free ipod order was submitted and passed verification. now they are processing it. hopefully I get it. I have passed all of the steps so far. maybe I will get a silver ipod in a couple days. then. if that works. I am going to try and get the free plasma screen tv. hhaha. ok. the cat is on my lap. not letting me type. I will go now. ready. cat typing:</p>

                <p>seriously I do. my new goal (well it is the same as my old goal - but with a bit more randomness) is awkwardness, juxtoposition and hyperbole. so basiclaly my life. hah. but I am excited. for the next couple days. work is becoming ultra cool. I think their will be some nice changes soon. it just seems like their will be. like the wind is blowing change my way. I do think it is funny - I could be the veritable harbinger of death and sorrow for developers - for I have never worked anywhere where as soon as I get hired the lead developer doesn't quit. I think that is weird. maybe they just catch "wind" of my skillz. haha. whatever. anyway. regardless of my nonsense words. I am pretty excited about work. I want to do more faster.<br></p>

<br>


<p>so after work there is going to be fun too. mike and my friend <a href="%20http://www.livejournal.com/users/caerrie/">carrie</a> are driving up from greality to come see the pixies tomorrow night. they will arrive tonight. the fun thing is - mike nor me have ever really met carrie. I have talked to her briefly while sleeping and chatted with her a number of times. I have followed her blog for awhile but yea. it is going to be awesome. or really weird and awkward. I vote for awesome. I am excited. EXCITED. hah. anyway. this brings me to the pixies. soooo. the pixies were incredible. I was very very happy to see them on saturday. they played an incredible set. all the songs I wanted to hear (except alec eifel). and they were just generally thrilling to see. kim deal was so nice. they did not talk a lot. really it was awesome. or it was awesome, really.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i am going to retire soon. to bed. I need to do work. now!</p>

                <p>this morning I woke up early. like 7:00. I was having a dream wher ei was invader zim and I was able to time travel (a combination of the two things I did last night between 2:30am and 4:00am). it ruled. I just buzzed around and had time traveling problems. I am currently reading this book by authur c clarke. it rules. I forgot what it is called. I have not bothered to look at the titles of the last two or three books. I find it interesting. I have also read a damned lot in the past couple weeks/months. it kinda rules. I shoudl reallystart a book log. haha. that lists all the books I have read and what I thought of them. it might be interesting. maybe I will do that. maybe I will. maybe. I will.<br></p>

<br>


<p>punctuation is sometimes annoying<br></p>

<br>


<p>i don't think I have one good friend who hasn't commented on the lack of blog entries I have made since I started my new job. it is cool to see that people are reading my blog. but it is sorta annoying that I have that as a following. I mean. I never did it expecting that I would be expected to do it again soon. heh. yea know. I just do it right now. and then if I do it again soon. it is almost a coincidence that I continue everyday. I never realized that people read it. haha. even thought he stats tell me otherwise. I may be stuck in my own universe. hmm. could I be?<br></p>

<br>


<p>i miscalculated my pay periods and I have totally screwed myself. haha. rule. I shoudl plan ahead more. and plan on buying less stuff. stupid buying. stupid money. nata2 is in dire straits. we shall see how this turns out. I think possibly ok. but eep. I hope so.<br></p>

<br>


<p>stupid money<br></p>

<br>


<p>oh oh oh. I purchased a new dvd player and haxored it into being region free. I got the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/external-search/107-8488385-1006951?tag=nata2productions&amp;mode=blended&amp;keyword=cyberhome">Cyberhome CH-DVD 320</a> at target for $38.00. it is about the size of a large 80s portable cd player. heh. or about the size of a sega genesis (sorta with a bit shaved off and it looks cooler). so I haxored it real easy like:</p>

<blockquote><small>Turn on power (with no disc inserted)<br>
Press Menu, 1, 9<br>
Select the Region option and press Enter<br>
Key number of desired region or 0 for region free<br>
Press Enter again to save changes<br>
Press Eject and insert your DVD</small></blockquote>


<p>now it plays ALL my dvds without fail. we watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363226/">Zat?ichi</a>. it was incredible. next is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0308379/">dark water</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0269266/">nightmare</a>, then <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338763/">battle royal 2</a>, then whatever and then whatever, and then whatever. it rules. I can order from hivizone with reckless abandon (whereas before I was so so conservative with my 100s of hong kong dvd orderings). you can never have <a href="http://dopeman.org/movies/">enough</a> I guess....<br></p>

<br>


<p>politics are dumb. tonight I get to go see fear factory. then to see the movie the grudge. I am excited. although really hungry. ;)</p>

<p>it was pretty harrowing to watch unfold. I mean. it appeared that we didn't even have a chance. and then I started drinking. which made the whole thing rediculous. I am now sleepy from drinking too much with too little food and too little consideration for reality. all I remember is laying on my bed and calling for my friends. then wooosh - morning. heh. and then we get bush for another four years. why is this how america rolls. this isn't rolling hard. this is rolling idiotically. I mean seriously. besides an isolationist, negative foreign policy and a hatred of foreigners what have we gained? oh yea. I forgot - war. nice. stupid war. stupid bush. haha. I am tired of all this.<br></p>

                <p>heh. yea so my friends have "caught" me. busted for sure:</p>

<blockquote><small><b>[@vanwinkle]</b> is harper giving up blogging?<br>
<b>[clock]</b> yeah I think so its been forever<br>
<b>[@vanwinkle]</b> whatever happened to three post per day minumum?<br>
<b>[@scottv]</b> he got a job</small></blockquote>


<p>So basically I have been just chilling out hard. not doig anything. I get home and I don't play computer or anything. I really should. I have so many projected that I should finish. they would be easy. and I could make some quick cache. but oh no. I just sit around. and read. I think that is all I have done in my house the last couple months. that and play video games. I lead the life of a philosophy student/<a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2FIncoming&amp;img=high_times.jpg">stoner</a>. except I don't <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2FIncoming&amp;img=fires-colo062002.jpg">smoke</a>. heh. and I am not lame. oh wait. ummm. yea.<br></p>

<br>


<p>hmmm lets see. the last time I updated my blog was in 1983. what has happened since. well I graduated elementry school and moved on to middle school. I saw david bowie. umm. what else.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i need a mirror so I can see when people are entering my cube. it is killing me. I keep "feeling" movement and it is destroying my life. I keep snapping my head around and I am starting to get a neck ache. ;)<br></p>

<br>


<p>anyway. a bunch of fun stuff has happened since I last posted. nata2.info stills pulls a BUNCH of bandwidth. as of today it has pulled about <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;q=725266224+kilobytes+to+gigabytes&amp;btnG=Search">691.66777 gigabytes</a> in october. wtf. that is 2350920 hits and 249529 pageviews. roughly 39057 visits. heh. that rules. I have conceptually had my entire home town visit my website. almost. well not really at all. but a town of almost 39k. hah. stupid numbers. also on the popular site front - the falaphilia site peaked with 24353 visits in one day and has dropped to less than 150 in a week. We were mentioned on numerous news sites and got quite a bit of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=falaphilia&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official">blog coverage</a>. it was pretty nuts. I like it when the internet is awesome.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i wonder what will be next. I got some ideas. but I need something to help me execute them. possibly time. haha. that is why we just subscribed to direct tv. I am going legit. I did however hack the shit out of my tivo. so now I get all the fancy backdoors and such - but I am a legit subscriber (of both tivo and dtv - wtf). It was pretty fun to do. I didn't have to do any of the hard stuff. the <a href="http://dopeman.org/directivo">directivo scene</a> has everything pretty solid. the hacks I applied are as follows: upgraded my drive to 160gb (120 usable), upgraded the OS to 4.0whatever (found on emule w00t - supports wireless internet updating and such native), enabled telnet, tivoweb, ftp, mfs_ftp, tytools and all that jazz, unscrambled the recordings and applied a couple misc hacks for good measure(perm 30 sec skip). It is a nice device now (whereas before it sucked??). I can't wait until I get the streaming from the tivo working. I will be able to watch my shows from my computer - while matt or matiss are playing video games. after times like this I remember how awesome I am. haha. I rule.<br></p>

<br>


<p>so I have been trying to take it easy as and save money as well as go out and spend money. it is a worthless endeavor. basically I just go out and then feel guilty about it later. it is a lot of fun however. just not aligned with my goals. hah.<br></p>

<br>


<p>this weekend was pretty cool and fun. friday was weird. we hung out - it was scottv's bday. we just chilled. stopped by the lumpen select closer. didn't see any of my friends. left. went to soundbar. it was pretty good. slept. woke up. installed direct tv. tipped the installer. he about died. I think he said thank you 1 billion times.<br></p>

<br>


<p>this reminds me of my new personal goal: to engage in justaposition and hyperbole from now on. yea. I will do it.<br></p>

<br>


<p>so saturday - we went to see suzanne and co at Y bar. but the doors were closed so we waited outside until amjad and friends shoed up for some soundbar action. we <a href="http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/pictures/events/2004%3A10%3A24_Amjad_in_chicago/IMG_2063.jpg">hung</a> <a href="http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/pictures/events/2004%3A10%3A24_Amjad_in_chicago/IMG_2062.jpg">out a bit</a>. then we went to crobar. where it was madness. Hiromi and I ended up riding the train home at 6:30am. hah. rule. <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A24_Amjad_in_chicago">here are the pictures</a>. then last night, <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A24_Halloween_Movieside&amp;img=IMG_2204.jpg">matiss</a> and <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A24_Halloween_Movieside&amp;img=IMG_2119.jpg">I</a>, <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A24_Halloween_Movieside&amp;img=IMG_2122.jpg">juggled</a> at a film fest for rusty nails. it ruled. I got real real tired. we made zombie clothes by cutting up old clothes - then taking them outside and <a href="http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/251020041248/Nokia6600(728).jpg">burning them</a>. it was awesome. the show went really good. check out the pictures <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A24_Halloween_Movieside">here</a>.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i am now going to get my vote on. my absentee vote. cuz my work is sending me to salt lake city for training. it will be pretty interesting. I have never been there - and I imagine that it is pretty crazy. crazy like a church. I will have to bring a couple books. what is crazy is my life starting on friday. first I leave for nyc to hang with some friends. I am really excited. then I have crazy parties. then I fly from nyc to cincinnati at 6am, then from cincinnati to salt lake at 8:40am. haha. keep in mind that I am going to a halloween party on sunday that will go until late. hah. I am screwed. luckily I have a cross country flight and won't be in meetings until the afternoon session. I will also be able to catch up on my rest. w00t.<br></p>

                <p>however, I don't feel very tired. I really don't understand how it is that I am able to lead this weird dual life. my friend adam equated it to the original mods from the 50s and 60s. he said they used to have normal jobs(working 9-5) and look like business people - then after work they would transform into these fashion seeking scene people. right after my friend adam told me this he started shouting "prolatariet." but anyway - I sometimes don't understand how I find my self at work less than 6 hours after I was last "out." regardless of the activity - I am always "out" before going to work. weird. I am lost in my typing.<br></p>

<br>


<p>so this weekend was pretty fun. it as always started on thursday with <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A07_tommie_at_metro&amp;img=IMG_1964.jpg">tommie spinning</a> at smartbar. <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A07_tommie_at_metro&amp;img=IMG_1954.jpg">danielle</a> and I <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A07_tommie_at_metro&amp;img=IMG_1958.jpg">hung out</a> there. a lot of fun. I wasn't really into being crazy and danielle wsa tired and claims not to be a dancer(we will soon see the truth) - so it was a pretty chill night out. a lot of fun. I took a <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A07_tommie_at_metro&amp;img=IMG_1968.jpg">neat picture</a> of <a href="http://morganbreaksthings.blogspot.com/">morgan</a> and <a href="http://thatswherebatslive.blogspot.com/">miles</a>.<br></p>

<br>


<p>on friday I went home after work and changed into my "young republican" clothing to enable me to participate in my local political gathering. I met <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A09_debates_and_crobar&amp;img=IMG_1978.jpg">scott, jeff</a> and <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A09_debates_and_crobar&amp;img=IMG_1979.jpg">monica</a> at frankie Zs bar on clark for a kerry event to support him during the debates. it was pretty fun. I think we were rowdy. and then with stops to hard rock hotel bar, sugar and a porn store, we finally made it to crobar. heh. were we met <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A09_debates_and_crobar&amp;img=IMG_1982.jpg">hiromi</a>. it was pretty fun. my friend <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A09_debates_and_crobar&amp;img=IMG_1990.jpg">tracy</a> and a bunch of her friends also participated in the insanity. it was a pretty fun night. after crobar - we went to redno, and then my friend james' space for an after hours and then to scotts house. omg. I got home at around 6:30am. I was not aware that flash taco has a closing time. haha.<br></p>

<br>


<p>so then on saturday I needed to rest. so I did. I went to bed bath and beyond and picked up some stuff with matiss. the sales people reacted pretty funny to us. I mean we don't look your typical lincoln park hotties. well I don't matiss on the other hand. seriously looks LP. totally trixie. it ruled. so now I can't wait for the cold to come. all I want to do is to snuggle into my bed. with soft things and read books that are dark. dark like my heart. after our excursion - I went with hiromi and jordan to a bbq. and then I went to corbar to pick up some money that jordan was owed. we drank lots and forgot the money. stupid bars. then I went to bed. pretty early for a saturday. I missed hanging out with some people which sucked. but I got to sleep.<br></p>

<br>


<p>so on sunday - I played a bunch of video games with matt and matiss. it ruled. then I returned some stuff to BBB. heh. lame. then I went to an awesome bbq at chao's house. then game night at my place. we played this awesome game called bang. and then a couple games of speed scrabble. at that time I went to claudia's BBQ at this guy lloyds house. it was fun. really really good pork chops. heh. I love bbqs. after the bbq I went to exit with devon. it was fun to hang out. we then went to her place and had tea and hung out with her dog. I got home at 3. and slept really well.<br></p>

<br>


<p>this week will bring some fun stuff going down. I am finally getting work to do at my job. we are in the middle of launching some stuff so everything si really on hold. I will soon be effective. haha.<br></p>

<br>


<p>my friends are all going to india in january. stupid non-corporate workers. I want to go.</p>

                <p>last night was pretty fun. I hung out with hannah. we went to the faint. but first I slept until 8. rule. I love naps. I nede to eat better and sleep better. that is the way to the future. anyway. I hung out with hannah and we saw the faint. it was pretty good. tv on the radio ruled me. &lt;3. I was so surprised at how hard they rocked. the guitar was incredible. so drilling. I loved it.<br></p>

<br>


<p>so I started my new job. I haven't really updated this in awhile. but I did start. it is a lot more fun than my last job. it is weird how the attitudes/mood of the organization affects a person. at the WB I felt totally stifled. like I wasn't able to be myself(i forced it on them) and I wasn't able to do everything that I know how to do. I wasn't allowed to be an expert in my field. here however - they leverage the smarts a person has and they try and use every bit of it. it rules. by the second day I felt a lot better about everything and I really was happy I had made this decision.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i don't have a lot of work yet. but that will all change as I become more acclimated with the environment. everyone else is working very hard - launching things, meeting deadlines. I am excited to be in code soon. and to understand more the ceiling and floor of the situation. at that point I will know how much I can do/get away with - both in regards to my self and with the company. the weird thing is that when I am herei totally don't mind staying late. because I don't hate it fundamentally. I get to wear jeans. I get to come in at 9ish. etc etc. rule. but overall I just feel better. it could be jus the fanciness of the new. but it also could be working among people who want you to be smart. not that my team at wb didn't want me to be smart - but they limit themselves and the non-technical staff controls and ultimately destroys the projects there. it is sad.<br></p>

<br>


<p>as I have been taking it very chill. just working, then coming home and reading. it rules. that last comma probably doesn't need to be there. anyway. I have been reading a bunch of banana yoshimoto. she is really good. all o fher books talk a lot about death. I think I read somewhere that her books are "always talking about death but never let the reader forget that life must go on." or something like that. it seems that is in fact what she does. I finished asleep the other day and it was so full of sorrow. a trio of sad stories - but in every story the reader is led through this emotional world where things aren't working correctly and where things are depressing - but I found that I never leave the books depressed. they don't sit heavy. they leave the reader feeling satisfied - as if the protagonist has fulfilled whatever they are missing. they are really beautiful novels. they are also so tiny. I just got done with amrita. it was a mess. my favorite part was after finishing it - there is an apology from yoshimoto apologizing for the mess of a novel it is. she seemed upset that it was long and tenuous. heh. it was. but it was still good. I laughed in the beginning when suddenly they brought up philip k dick's novel "flow my tears a policeman said." it made me want to read dick again. you know how I love dick. haha. umm that was for you mike.<br></p>

<br>


<p>the wierdest part of getting a new job is the commute. seriously. it hasn't changed at all. nothing has changed except the "building" and the elevator bank. it is so strange to see the same people. walk the same streets. but not be involved in the same way. yep.<br></p>

<br>


<p>so I also got this book called "Haruki Murakami and the Music of Words" by jay rubin. rubin is my favorite translator of the murakami stuff. he lays it down so beautifully. it really recreates what I imagine to be incredible script. the <a href="http://www.complete-review.com/reviews/murakamih/rubinj.htm">reviews</a> seem to suggest that it isn't really that great of a book. or well at least it isn't as complete as you might imagine. however. I just want to know more. apparently haruki murakami is now the most widely read japanese author (in the west). haha the west. yea. but I do find it odd that the most widely read japanese author in the west writes very strange dark tales that are both weirdly erotic and dark beneath all perception. the impression that gives to japan. heh. poor japan. always so so dark. they should turn a light on.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i don't have a lot to say. generally. but apparently not writing for a couple weeks will make me a bit more verbose than usual.<br></p>

<br>


<p>work gave me this new laptop. it rules. well sorta. it is full of "business" features. but the one feature which seriously seriously rules is the built in LED light on the top of the screen. I am so amazed at the throughthought of this laptop. (is throughthought a word. I doubt it. I imagine it is two words. I like it as one word. it reminds me of 1984.) my keyboard rest is going to kill me. I need my docking station, a monitor and a better keyboard. wierd. yea then it will be better.<br></p>

<br>


<p><a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A01_last_day_of_worldbook">here</a> are some picture of my "last day" party with my coworkers. it was trouble. serious. serious trouble. but honestly not as much trouble as the last bbq at claudias house. pictures are <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A03_Claudias_bbq">here</a>. now that was some trouble. I woke up on monday for the first day on my new job with a bunch of bruises, a scrape or two, four temp tattoos on very visible parts of my body and a cigarette burn on my neck. wtf. it was one of those situations where you exclaim happiness that life is as fun as it is. but then you duck and hope to sleep for the rest of winter.<br></p>

<br>


<p>so I have been hanging out on the internet with my friend natasha. she sent me a bunch of stuff from her work. which I promptly wore and created <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2FIncoming&amp;img=high_times.jpg">this action shot</a>. those who know me well will realize the pure humor in this. those that don't know me possibly will not find as much humor in it. I laughed a lot.<br></p>

<br>


<p>a couple weeks ago I had a chance to play with this strange little contraption called the ogo. it rules. I posted a review of it <a href="http://3gcoding.com/archives/2004/09/ogo_review.php#more">here</a>. check it out.<br></p>

<br>


<p>anyway. I am probably back. I need a nap. so that means I am somewhere. which is half, if not three fourths of the battle.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i love battles.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i almost believe that kerry might have a chance. weird. stupid hope.<br></p>

<br>


<p>my new plan is to eat more at home. I have a crock pot and I just got a rice cooker. I am going to have roast and rice every night for the next 6 months. totally atkins. I will be so fat it will be hard to understand the reality of the situation. rule.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i also broke and fixed the photolog. it is a hack. but will work for now. I am pretty excited. I started goign to juggling again. it rules. I am working on solo clubs. it is really cathartic and I really enjoy it. so relaxing. so last week I was talking to my frien angus who was on the newton team and he said he would lend me his newton for a week or so to play with it. so excited. I love devices. maybe I will write a review of it. haha. compared to the new devices I have used. I am pretty thrilled. stupid apples.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i ate two bananas this morning.</p>

                <p>i totally didn't know that my blog was public. haha. jk.<br></p>

<br>


<p>so I was talking to my friend and she relayed information that my blog was the topic of a conversation in a meeting about rss feeds. I was used to demonstrate how "people need to keep in mind that anybody can read what you post." this was apparently especially true in light of my post about me resigning.<br></p>

<br>


<p>well. first off. I am not an idiot. hahaha. I am totally awesome. and I have been blogging for <a href="http://www.nata2.org/archives.php">roughly 5 years</a>. I write about everything. and anything that comes to mind. I don't pay attention to what is "appropriate" for a blog. I don't allow comments. I do this for myself. similar to my pictures. haha. they are all of myself. cuz myself rules.<br></p>

<br>


<p>btw. in case you were wondering. this post is dumb<br></p>

<br>


<p>but I digress. really I was annoyed that someone woudl read my blog and then think that I didn't expect them to read my blog. wtf. I post almost everything that happens to me and I post "<a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A01%3A31_andriods_on_ice&amp;img=thong%20party%20050.jpg">wild</a> and <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A01%3A31_chicago_thong">crazy</a>" party pictures. haha. that is because I am awesome. omg. I am also apparently retarded.<br></p>

<br>


<p>it is all thought out. it is mine. I hope you like it.</p>

                <p>seriously. I was just sitting here at home waiting for things to happen. and BAM something happened. I got an email from minmouse@sbcglobal.net. heh. rule. here it is:</p>

<blockquote><small>Hey Faggot,<br>
At least I'll wake up who I am tomorrow..... But Nata's RETARD, well he will still be RETARDED in the am. You faggot will still wake up a faggot in the morning.</small></blockquote>


<p>I am apparently am going to wake up someone who I am not tomorrow - if I compare myself to that guy. hmm. weird. anyway. as john says:</p>

<blockquote><small><b>John E Toughguy:</b> Life is good when your only enemies have trouble putting actual sentences together. It makes things easier.</small></blockquote>


<br>


<br>


<p>yes I did break nata2.info. but hopefully things will come back together very very soon. I am migrating all my sites from the old server to the new server. it is hard. I was using apache 2.0 but then I read about the problems with threadsafe applications using not threadsafe plugins and extensions. so apache and php(both threadsafe) may work fine - but gd or freetype may destroy life. so I downgraded apaches and upgraded phps. not hp 5 yet. but at least the newest version. so anyway. check out <a href="http://nata2.info">nata2.info</a> in a bit and hopefully it will work. I lov emy DESTROYER way of upgrading. it rules. RULES.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i am sickly. i need to restructure everything and it will be the same.</p>

<br>

                <p>haha.<br></p>

<br>


<p>so this weekend was pretty ridiculous. it was generally out of control. basically I just hung out and did the things that make my life incredible. haha. it all started on Wednesday (of course).<br></p>

<br>


<p>so for the past couple weeks I have been working nights a lot. so I have also had a LOT of screwed up sleep - i.e. none. especially at night. soo... on Wednesday I was struggling with attempting to not stay up all night - so I hung out at home and though about sleeping. at around 12 I went over to this bar called elm street liquors and hung out with some friends who spin there. it was pretty dope - it isn't the coolest bar, but it is not so bad. we then went to vips and hung out at the strip club. haha. I have gone to a strip club more in the last month than I have ever wanted to. like 4 times. hah. and I keep going. it is weird. just a place to go I guess. so we closed vips. I got tacos and then played computer. I was kinda late for work that day (weird I know).<br></p>

<br>


<p>then on thrusday, my friend greg and I just hung out at <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A08%3A27_crobar&amp;img=IMG_1249.jpg">crobar</a>, the W and neo. it was real laid back - but once again - out until 5.<br></p>

<br>


<p>and then friday - I hung out with my friend crystal. it was pretty fun. we just chilled around the city. got Italian ice in Lincoln park - watched hero. it was pretty good in the theatre. after that crystal went home and derek came.<br></p>

<br>


<p>this is were the weekend gets pretty retarded<br></p>

<br>


<p>so derek and got together and then met my friends at crobar. crobar was <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A08%3A27_crobar&amp;img=IMG_1253.jpg">pretty</a> <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A08%3A27_crobar&amp;img=IMG_1263.jpg">nuts</a> and we got a lot of drink and I swear we barely made it home. heh.<br></p>

<br>


<p>then on saturday we met at crobar for the metallica show. we took an <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A08%3A28_Metallica_and_crobar&amp;img=DSC05500.jpg">escalade limo</a> (wtf). it was pretty awesome. there was <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A08%3A28_Metallica_and_crobar&amp;img=DSC05512.jpg">food and drinks</a>. and it was a pretty <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A08%3A28_Metallica_and_crobar&amp;img=DSC05532.jpg">good show</a>. one of the people who came with us brought her parents. her mom, mary, was really awesome. we gave her a <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A08%3A28_Metallica_and_crobar&amp;img=DSC05540.jpg">lesson</a> in <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A08%3A28_Metallica_and_crobar&amp;img=DSC05542.jpg">rock</a>. she was <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A08%3A28_Metallica_and_crobar&amp;img=DSC05610.jpg">hardcore</a>. ;) as were <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A08%3A28_Metallica_and_crobar&amp;img=DSC05611.jpg">we</a>. after that we went to transit - were I danced a lot. and then went to <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A08%3A28_Metallica_and_crobar&amp;img=DSC05674.jpg">crobar</a> and hung out. a lot of <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A08%3A28_Metallica_and_crobar&amp;img=DSC05657.jpg">fun</a>.</p>

                <p>So i have been really busy with a bunch of random and unrelated things. Basically i haven't engaged in anything mobile technology at all - which is annoying. i need to play more. <a href="http://www.therats.org">matiss</a> just got a phone with a camera. so i imagine i will be creating a simple way to do a photoblog for him. i hope anyway it will go well. i really need to acquire or figure out how to quickly get a sms gateway. i need it. haha.</p>

<p>i guess i have been up to the following:</p>


<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.itunesblogger.com">itunesblogger.com</a>: my friend <a href="http://blog.andrewcarlson.com">andy</a> and i were talking about the fancy newish <a href="http://developer.apple.com/sdk/itunescomsdk.html">iTunes COM for Windows SDK</a> that allows developer to write apps that hook into itunes and do fancy things. andy and i had toyed with posting our recently updated songs to the internet and we decided that it woudl be fun to write a c# application that did it very smoothly. so <a href="http://www.itunesblogger.com/wiki/wakka.php?wakka=HomePage">we did</a>. it rules. from the description:
<blockquote>iTunesBlogger is a utility to track what is being played in iTunes and post information about each track (e.g. track name, artist, etc.) to a web script, or to the clipboard via a hotkey.</blockquote>
Awesome. i was also able to get a really good handle on c#. i plan to use it for a bunch of fun utilities. including writing an api that will interface with my <a href="http://www.ambientdevices.com/cat/orb/orborder.html">ambient orb</a>. then i will be able to do cooler stuff with it.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.jokesareawesome.com">jokesareawesome.com</a>: awhile ago a friend of mine was telling me lots of relaly bad jokes. so we started looking for a joke site that was easy and good. we found a bunch of sites that had bad jokes and a couple sites that had fortune style joke databases. but no site was very good in regards to organization or display. so i grabbed a free joke database and BAM went to town. it is a very simple site and uses some relaly simple/fun dhtml.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.gmail.com">gmail</a>: although i didn't write this ;) i have been playing with it quite a bit. i have ran my own mail service for the last 7 years and haven't needed email for that long. so attempting to use another service is insane. i don't quite know what i think of it. i don't know if i can treat email the same again either. it is a lot like instant messaging. it is pretty wierd. i like it.</li>
</ul>


<p>i guess i should update my webpages. i really need to fix a bunch of stuff. and just make shit tighter. then i can get back on the mobile bandwagan. i am goign to try and get a black berry through work. we will see. ;)</p>

                <p>so the past month - I have reengaged my ears in a black metal journey. it is awesome. I &lt;3 black metal. I have been listening to primarily dimmu borgir, cradle of filth and emperor. however - I have delved into a bit of bathory and my old favorite therion. it all rules so so much. my current favorites are dimmu borgir's new album "death cult armageddon" and cradle of filth's "from cradle ot enslave." so so good. I will probably end up worshiping the devil and killing my roommates - only to get sick from drinking their blood. the sickness will cause me to be hospitalized and then the "authorities" will find the remains of my roomates and I will get into trouble. but - that is the risk I am willing to take - cuz this music RULES. haha. umm.. yea..<br></p>

<br>


<p>so I found a REALLY REALLY good document about taking apart and iMac. now I just have to find the power supply part. hehe. check out <a href="http://www.appletalk.com.au/forums/index.php?showtopic=718">this site</a> for a similar doc.<br></p>

<br>


<p>yesterday beck's friend tamour hooked up with us and <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1087163325-Nokia6600(904).jpg">we juggled</a>. it was pretty fun. then we hung out. matiss and I played quake - while listening to black metal of course - and then tamour called and we got dinner. I then went to my pseudo date and then met tamour at smartbar - where we didn't get in. so I went home. and went to bed. it ruled. I need to sleep a bit more.<br></p>

<br>


<p>skinny puppy is soon. I am excited.<br></p>

<br>


<p>if you press ctrl-h in aim it will put a hr tag. basically. hehe. weird.</p>

I think rachel is gunna give me this old bike of hears. I will prolly paint penises all over it and call it the "cock rocket" - umm... I mean.. yea...<br>
so after I hung out with rachel - I took a nap. I had meant to goto starsky and hutch - which is playing at the logan - but I accidently slept until 9:30. doh. so I walked to lula and got salmon. mmm &lt;3 salmon.<br></p>

<br>


<p>check out this hilarious conversation I had today with some random person. haha.</p>

<blockquote><small><b>sylvanrage</b>: you still in chicago?<br>
<b>linuXKilla</b>: of course<br>
<b>sylvanrage</b>: I'm gonna be up there in 2-3 weeks<br>
<b>sylvanrage</b>: can I have your phone #<br>
<b>sylvanrage</b>: and<br>
<b>sylvanrage</b>: Do you wanna make out?<br>
<b>linuXKilla</b>: who are you<br>
<b>sylvanrage</b>: aren't you morgan?<br>
<b>linuXKilla</b>: hahahaha<br>
<b>linuXKilla</b>: omg<br>
<b>linuXKilla</b>:<br>
<b>sylvanrage</b>: so you aren't morgan thorac?<br>
<b>linuXKilla</b>: nope<br>
<b>sylvanrage</b>: or however that is spelled<br>
<b>sylvanrage</b>: do you know her<br>
<b>linuXKilla</b>: however.<br>
<b>linuXKilla</b>: I am friends with her<br>
<b>sylvanrage</b>: well<br>
<b>sylvanrage</b>: she usually has hot friends<br>
<b>sylvanrage</b>: so I'm sure I'd be happy to make out with you too<br></small></blockquote>


<p>HOW MY LIFE RULES. haha. I was like. wtf. then it was very funny. I don't really know how to react to that. other than laugh. I sent it to all my friends. haha. morgan was like "TELL HIM I MOVED OR DIED." hehe. rule.<br></p>

<br>


<p>hiromi works now. as does matt and matiss. so once again I have from 6 until around 10 to hang out with myself. which is awesome. I get SOOOO bored. heh. so I usually sleep. now I remember how I started taking naps. I guess I need to gather some friends - even though I apparently have some - I can't seem to find any from 6-9.<br></p>

<br>


<p>ok I guess I should goto bed. work is sucking lately. it was awesome. then suckage. stupid people who are not in aggrement with me. haha. well whatever. I will fight the "good" battle and probably lose. but its cool.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i will post a surprise later tomorrow night. it will rule. you will smile.</p>

                <p>hehe. this weekend was an incredible experiment in what I can take - mostly in regards to sleep deprevation - but also in regards to alcohol poisoning. which is really something I am not exactly proud of - but it was a lot of fun. so it all started on thrusday. me and some friends went to a smartbar party - and then to crobar. I had to try out my new "drop my name and you can get into crobar for free" trick (seriously - on thursdays just say your there to see harper reed - it should work). the tricked worked. and crobar was pretty dope. most of my friends make fun of me about it. but seriously. it is fun sometimes. &lt;3. haha.<br>
so anyway. after crobar I of course went to bed. and ROCKED work the next day. we had a couple relaly important meetings and I ruled them. basically we had to make all of these HUGE changes and they are crazy and confusing. I also worked on my secret work project - which also rules. it is using c# to make some fancy XML conversion stuff. it is only a secret because I don't talk about it to anyone. it isn't like a real secret - which is too bad. I wish it was. I love secrets. so after work on friday - hilary and myself went to hard rock and had a beer. then we went to innjoy and saw a friend of mines art opening. it was pretty good. we got there really early so we just hung out and ate some food. after that we went to our homes and napped.<br>
then the party started. hilary and I met up around 11 and went to smartbar and waited for the stills to get over so we coudl hook up wth greg and co. we found greg and then went and got amjad. amjad was with george - which was really cool. cuz I totally miss seeing george. but we picked them up and made it to johnny love's party. which was packed with techno djs. johnny love is so funny. apparently there was some "confusion" and he got busted by the ladies. haha. rule. after johnny we went to crobar - and matt made us a couple mind erasers. it sorta worked. they were insane. like a race. we helled about and looked for claudia - to no avail. so we went back to johnnys party and hung out with cops. after that we walked to lazlos and ate food. until 6. then I walked home. it ruled.<br></p>

<br>


<p>so I woke up early on saturday and got lunch with morgan. then I got all fancied up and ready and went to a party with ayca. after the party we went to liars club - met amjad and micah (and their bodyguards wtf) and then went to y bar to see hiroki. then we went to spybar. and that is where my night ended. I played hardcore until I coudln't see any longer and then I treked my way home. barely making it. hah. it was funny. I woke up the next day with wax all over my clothes, bruises and numerous text messages wondering where I had disappeared to.<br></p>

<br>


<p>so then on sunday - I hung out with matiss and matt - we went and saw "day after tomorrow" - it had the worst plot ever - but had incredible computer effects. really cool looking. the "destroy LA" scene was awesome. then we came back and matiss and I went to an awesome bbq at our friend jills house. her and her husband are chefs - so the food was awesome. awesome. seriously. then courtney came over and hung out. it was nice to see her. I hadn't seen her really in quite awhile. so courtney and I went to see my friend jordan at some resturant called enya. it was nice. we just chilled. then I came home.<br></p>

<br>


<p>then today. I went to a couple bbqs. I also inadvertently ditched ayca. which I didn't really mean to do. it just happened. sad day. and then I went home. and then now happened.<br></p>

<br>


<p>it is weird. I am excited to goto work tomorrow. a lot of things are going on - and I am really excited to play with c# and make this application. it rules. &lt;3 programming sometimes.<br></p>

<br>


<p>rigth now I am tired. and my mind is stuck in a weird place. like when you have a song in your head for awhile. and you finally listen to it and it is better. but the song in my head is anna karenina - and I lost my book in black out katies car. so I have to get it back so I can get her out of my head. the world is crazy apparently.<br></p>

<br>


<p>what to read next. I think I am going to try gravity's rainbow again.</p>

I will be engaging in another weekend long sabbatical from the internet. but this time it will be a theoretical four days with a 1 day disappearing act when I come back. so you should send me crazy <a href="http://dopeman.org/indiasms/">messages</a> to my phone(thanks to those that sent me messages the past couple days), which will probably be on for the duration of the trip.<br></p>

<br>


<p>tonight it look sas though I will be involved in a talent show with my yoyo. stupid yoyo. hate yoyo. well not hate. but you know how it goes. ;)<br></p>

<br>

<br>


<p>word. I will see yall on tuesday. hah. weird eh.</p>

                <p>so last night vinay and myself hung around bangalore and went to different catholic churches. I met his wife and his mother and we just chilled out. it was nice and relaxing. I was in bed by 10 and asleep by 10:15. hah.<br></p>

<br>


<p>the churches were pretty cool. they are all very majestic and quite something. it was as I expected - a mix of indian and western stylings. vinay's favorite was the best one. it was where he got married and was the most colorful. a lot of jesus.<br></p>

<br>


<p>today at work there is a lot of games and such. it is pretty cool to see.<br></p>

<br>


<p>more blog later prolly.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i think I am going ot go clubbing again tonight. an dthen look at temples and such tomorrow. I did end up going shopping last night which was pretty fun. a lot of nice fashionable clothes for 500 or so rupies(about 10-12 dollars). rule. ok I am out. like an eye.<br></p>

<br>


<p>isn't <a href="http://www.bushwantswar.com/">this</a> weird??<br></p>

<br>


<p>here is a scary set of statistics: domains from the .mil tld downloaded a total of 13266 files from nata2.info. accounting for 3.39% of the total files served. they downloaded a total of 5558mb of files, 6.28% of the total files served. this is pretty crazy. especially when it is only the stats for 2.5 days in may (12, 13th and partially the 14th). I wonder what lists I am on ?</p>

                <p>last night my friends and I went to this pretty nice resturant and had excellent food and free beer. the night was advertised as "unlimited intoxication" - which seemeingly is a misnomer. what does misnomer mean? so we hung out there and I had excellent tandori chicken kabobs and lotsa fish. it all ruled oh so much. good good food. then suresh and I went to a club called spin. apparently there is only about 50 things globally that you are allowed to call a club. and spin is obviously one of them. so we went to spin and hung out with some of suresh's friends. they were very nice. it was nice to talk to none software young people - who were progressive(by progressive I mean interested in moving forward - not necessarily interested in becoming western(which way is forward - I have no idea)). they were almost all professionals - one was an architect and one was a student. the other one worked for an NGO which dealt with education reform of the slum children. hah. but yea. it was neat to talk to them. it was also very comfortable to be in a club. &lt;3 clubs. I am lame.<br></p>

<br>


<p>so then I came home and uplaoded my pictures to my computer and then slept. I was able to sleep in a little which was nice.<br></p>

<br>


<p>one funny thing that happened is my driver came and picked me up at 9:15 yesterday - however my guest house guy thought the driver was supposed to pick me up at 8:30. so the driver is now getting into trouble. hah. I had to clear it up. also. just now a man came with a coke on a platter. for me. rule. &lt;3 coke. ;)<br></p>

<br>


<p>the club last night played pretty good music. it was for the most part old, but some of it was nice. a lot of house(of course) and a lot of indianish house stuff. which ruled. I am hopefully going to be picking up some music this weekend. I want some rock and some dance stuff - and then a couple of the bollywood remix cds. hah.<br></p>

<br>


<p>rule. hey yall. thanks for all the messages. ;) and I am starting to ignore the smell of mothballs which pervades my room in the guesthouse.<br></p>

<br>


<p>hopefully I will be posting pictures soon. I will link to them here.</p>

                <p>yesterday and last nigth was pretty fun. guru, siddu and myself all went around bangalore again. this time we hung out in a very popular and modern area with lots of shops. I went to this great little shop that had some nice sandlewood and such. it was all very nice but really expensive. so I lost money in that gamble. and probably yall gained some gifts ;). I then purchased a swatch watch(mainly cuz I have NO idea what time it is and when I landed I was confused for days) and I got some bangels for my lady friends (if they are not mean like some (heh)). I then was stricken with feelings of both extreme hunger and extreme fatigue(stupid airplanes and dates) and was totally confused - so we went to this really "western" place and had excellent food.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i am almost completely amazed at the "british" influence that is still apparent here. at the resturant everyone was interested in engaging in this weird servitude version of waiting tables. all very polite, traditional and very formal. it weirded me out. mostly cuz I get nervous in those situations. but the british influence is everyehere - and as guru said "we have had only 50 years to get over it." so I guess it follows.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i have slowed down on the picture taking. I don't want to take too many pictures of "the natives" cuz that seems pretty rude - even though I am way more interested in capturing the lives my friends lead than I am interested in capturing some temple. also.. we saw some temples yesterday. they are awesome. like nothing else I have seen. they are like a mix of graceland, vegas and a chruch. it is all very pretty. I was able to surprise everyone with my ability to name the hindu gods (go kinnera) and hoepfully will be visiting some temples and christian chruches tomorrow.<br></p>

<br>


<p>the weather is just like california.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i got kinda homesick last night. mostly cuz I was soo tired and felt really weak. I wanted to just talk to one of my friends. this situation reminds me of how social I am. how I strive for social contact and interaction. I get plenty here. but I am so led around - I don't feel in control. and you know how I like control. hehe. stupid airplanes. but yea.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i yoyoed a bunch today. garnered some stares. heh. "surprise"<br></p>

<br>


<p>now I am going to go and do work. or something. oh and meetings here are awesome. everyone formally suggests a change and then all hell breaks loose and everyone yells. then everyone thinks and it repeats. it is like meetings with the dev people at work (so I guess it makes sense) so yea. it is awesome.<br></p>

<br>


<p>oh. and it is VERY interesting to see the al queda reacting to our horrible mess of abuse. wtf. I mean. one american publicly killed versus the 20 or so iraqis killed. hmm. weird. it doesn't make it right. but we shoudl once again look at WHY we are gettign attacked and not just blindly seek retribution (which I know we will(stupid bush)). it was interesting to see this in the newspaper this morning. it had such a small portion. heh. rule. nobody is surprised except the really ignorant U.S. I love international politics. go america. we rule. hah. umm yea.<br></p>

<br>


<p>my life has been rendered into searching for bottled water.</p>

                <p>so I can now make international calls to everyone. if you want to prank me - dial 9880281475. hah. umm yea. or something like that. I will try and set up an sms gateway so you can leave me messages. or I won't whatever.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i will post pictures soon. I promise.<br></p>

<br>


<p>now I need food. it is lunch time. which is weird I know - since I am posting this at 2:15 am. ;)<br></p>

<br>


<p>last night guru took me around to MG road (which is a lot like manhatten - weird) and we just hung out. I got my prepaid card and we ate some food. I also found some bottled water (w00t) and then had some beers. the bar was really fun. it was a ROCK bar and had pictures of rockers all around. I sat under a picture of frank zappa. it ruled. I shoudl have taken a picture. then we took a cab home and I went to bed. I woke up and discovered that there isn't hot water. nor a shower curtain. so I lathered myself up and sprayed freezing water at myself. I taste like soap still. so cold.. I then ate an incredible breakfast. it was good. dosas with coconut chutney... mmm... and then went to work. I inadvertently found out how to dial internationally and called alan and morgan. it was nice to talk to people I know. it is weird. I find myself struggling with a bit of culture shock. yesterday all I wanted was a sandwich. so I had one. today I just wanted to say hi to someone I knew. tomorrow I will probably want to get drunk and wrestle. yea know. the drill.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i woudl probably like to come back.<br></p>

<br>


<p>work is going well. it is nice cuz everyone here is all about getting work done - whereas in chicago - it is all about designing which is soo much more beurocratic(spelled horribly I am sure). the difference is very apparent when we have 1 one hour meeting that has results - versus a billion 2 hour meetings that spawn that 1 one hour meeting. I guess both are necessary - it is just amazing to see how fast everything gets done when the hard parts(design/content stuff) are already done. hehe. I guess I am saying I like the easy part. how lame am i. haha. suckers. I am in india. hahah.<br></p>

<br>


<p>ok I better go before I hurt myself.</p>

                <p>so I arrived in india. it is pretty awesome. quite a change from california where I have secretly been living for the past ten years.<br></p>

<br>


<p>it all started on thursday. the night befopre I was to leave for india. hehe. my friend mike and nic came over from colorado and we hung out. we went to sushi and then to crobar. things got crazy and mike inadvertently got really drunk and assaulted red haired matts gf. so he got kicked out of crobar and proceeded to be sad all around chicago. we went to exit then home. I woke up with a couple HUGE bruises on my body from wrestling nic and went to breakfast with morgan. it was nice to see her but got sad. I am lame. haha. I totally was bummed out. but then I left for india. and I got better.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i have sooo much spam. I need to install that spam filter crap<br></p>

<br>


<p>so anyway. I flew to frankfurt. then I flew to delhi. where I was picked up by my driver(who drove 100km/h everywhere). I went to bed. and then got up at 7:00am and drove to agra where the taj mahal resides.<br></p>

<br>


<p>now I must be clear about this cuz it sounds dumb. the taj mahal is quite possibly the most amazing thing I have seen. it was incredible. I have never been in a place like that. it is so perfect. and it is all marble. marble seems to me a rather "hard" medium to make a huge thing out of. and it apparently only took 22 years to make. wtf. ;) (oh and the guards at the taj kept messing with me - the first one kept touching my earrings and saying nice - and the second ome I woudl find a wife inside if I didn't already have one. it ruled)<br></p>

<br>


<p>in agra I went to a place where I was able to see the family that orginally did the inlay work that is on the taj. they are a bunch of kids sitting in a room making marble inlay stuff. it is pretty insane. I got some.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i also picked up a rug. haha.<br></p>

<br>


<p>my guide at the taj was awesome. he knew so much. he also took me to the red fort - which is also awesome. these monuments don't really make sto me. they are so incredible. both the taj and the red fort are things that I never really dreamed of actually existing. quite something. after taht we had some food. quite nice. wait. the order is screwed up. food. then red fort. also. everything is owned by tata (my hosts here). my "personal guide" (a really awesome guy who basically took care of me and was my company for the day in delhi) and I just hung out most of the day. it was seriously awesome. he told me all the secrets of india.<br></p>

<br>


<p>then we drove back. I saw and elephant and a monkey. also.. apparently a new trend is to buy the chassis of the truck and not get the body. it is cheaper and you can buy/build the body elsewhere. haha. wtf. I want to put a small car body on the chassis of the truck.<br br=""></p>

<br>


<p>i am taking a lot of pictures. they are probably all poor. but yea.<br></p>

<br>


<p>so I got back to delhi about 8 and I was incredibly tired. so I slept. and sleep I did. except for the dream of the rat eating my face (??was it a dream!?) everything went well.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i woke up this morning and flew to bangalore (which is quite nice - a lot more mild than delhi). jet airways is pretty awesome. almost better than lufthansa. and then I took a drive to my guest house. which is really nice. (btw - they DO refill the water bottles. I caught them.. hehe. well they refill them with purified water - but I don't trust taht stuff - only aquafina for me. good thing pepsi lives in india too). the guest houses are so so nice. I can't really describe what these small apartments are like. they are like in the movies. with balcony's overlooking pretty scenery and whatnot. it is pretty insane. I feel like I am in a foreign land. hah.<br></p>

<br>


<p>so that brings me up to date. tomorrow I will attempt to post pictures. also. I will attempt to get a phone with sms so I can bug all you ;) and post my photolog pictures. sad day I can't now. stupid lack of prep on my part. ;) hehe.</p>

                <p>i listened to cat power on the way to work. man. that music is sad. hah. I think one of my favorite songs by her is "<a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=2960659&amp;selectedItemId=2960635">good</a> <a href="http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Good-Woman-lyrics-Cat-Power/744491FBEBC1CBE748256D41000D087E">women</a>." hmm. kinda sad. ;)<br></p>

<br>


<p>last night was pretty fun. I went and saw black print at the double door, then I went and I hung out with severn and val at danny's. it was fun to hang out with them. I realized while walking to danny's by myself - that I really shoudln't just hang out with my room. unlike some of my friends, I get a lot of power from hanging out wiht people. it makes me go. heh. and the last couple days I have hung out with my room, my rommmates and morgan. all of which has been good. but I haven't really hung out with my friends. so last night. I did that and it ruled. heh. so anyway.. after I hung out at danny's I went to the big horse (ugh) and saw matt and erica's band play. they were really good. it was pretty cool. I hope they get some good gigs. I would like to see them at a legit venue (rather than the big horse). hah. then I somehow managed to goto club foot, and then somehow I managed to make it to the <a href="http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/060520040916/Nokia6600(656).jpg">hollywood grill</a>. seriously. wtf. I have no idea how I can do that (the food heh). but yea.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i end up waiting for emails far too often. I hate that.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i need to pack. right now everything is grouped appropriately. however it isn't packed right. I need to make sure I have everything. I am scared about that. I imagine it will work out. unless I forget my passport in frankfurt or something. hah.<br></p>

<br>


<p><a href="http://proxientunit.com/">mike</a> and nic are coming over tonight. they are flying currently. it will be really nice to see them. if only for the couple hours.<br></p>

<br>


<p>work ho..</p>

                <p>i hate feelings. I hate how small things can cause such weird reverberations within my self. it is hard. I can't sleep. it hasn't anything to do with anything. I just lay down. and I look at the ceiling. and I get kinda sad. not really depressed or pointedly sad. just a sinking feeling. like. I don't know what is going on in my head. but I do know. it isn't really all that weird. just annoying. I was spooked. I often am.<br></p>

<br>


<p>so I yoyoed a bunch. that helped. I practiced some new tricks. I got some good ones. you should check them out. I really like my night moves 3. it is dope. very smooooth. heh. however it is like 3:45 and I am not in bed. I have to work at 9 of course. andi have been home since 1. sitting in my room. wallowing of sorts. not really doing anything. wishing there was something to do. I miss conversations. I got a taste yesterday of what I miss. and it is a lot better now. which is relaly good. however. it also reminded me (when I am alone listening to depressing music and not really being rational) of the feelings once felt. and how they are not really different. just un-accompolishable. hah. I would like to say whatever without negating my post. so here. whatever. hah.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i am almost fully prepared to goto india. that is pretty exciting. I need to listen to different music very bad. this music is killing me. hah. I don't know what to listen to though. I am not really in the mood for anything. I guess I am attempting to sleep so I don't really need to listen to something good. maybe something more calm. hah. like arvo part or whatever. hmm. I will soon see.<br></p>

<br>


<p>this too will pass. I know.</p>

                <p>tonight I am going to dinner with morgan. it is kinda weird. I haven't seen her since we broke up. I am a bit apprenhensive - not really about seeing her. just about the whole situation. it is kinda scary. haha. I am glad, however that it is scary by design and not scary or uncomfortable because I happened to run in to her randomly. we have been talking on email - so it shoudln't be too uncomfortable. I guess I just worry about what happens when life moves on - but my inside(heart/brain - etc) doesn't. yea know. it could be weird/hurtful. I doubt it. but I am often the pessimist in regards to this kinda stuff. stupid this kinda stuff. umm. whatever. ;) I really don't know what I feel at this point - so it should be interesting ;)<br></p>

<br>


<p>i need to do laundry. that I what I feel. hah.<br></p>

<br>


<p>last nigth was pretty fun. I went tot rainbo with claudia and her friends, went to spybar to see jeffrey, then went to neo with jeffrey and his friend and finally made it to crobar. crobar was INSANE as usual. I hung out with claudia's friends. they were dope. really funny. apparently I am supposed to buy then all stuff from india. hah. weird. I had a good time. I got home real late (but not that late) and slept like a bunny.</p>

<p>last night was fun. it was a good friday. I hung out with hiromi, claudia, felix and felix's crew. we went to crobar and chilled. it was nice. I drank a little bit of alcohol and then went home and slept. it was/is hot in our apt.<br></p>

                <p>tonight I went and brainstormed with john and hannah for hours. it was mind numbing. afterwards we kidnapped marcia and took her to smokedaddy's. I had never been there, and I had never really heard of it. however it was quite good. I had a briskett sandwich. it ruled. I got all dirty. I ate so much so fast. sometiems beer and food tastes so damn good. it is pretty funny. we gorged ourselves. then suddenly felt the need to escape. adn we did. I went home and crashed hard around 10:30. it was such a release to just eat and then sleep with no repercusions. leprechauns. I need to listen to pretty music.<br></p>

<br>


<p>this weekend is full of excitingly good bands playing. first on friday is "tv on the radio" and then on saturday pinback and enon at the logan. hte logan ballroom is funny cuz it is accross the street. heh. also on friday is felix at crobar. that will be fun. chris will be back. it will be nice.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i just wrote something and deleted it. I hate that.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i am ready "the world according to garp." I quite enjoy it. I am listening to the new fantomas disc. I am bord with it. I think I am going to put on the new "why" album I just got. it is nice. like "tv on the radio" hip hop - hehe.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i think it is weird to attempt to avoid reality.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i just put the new "why" album on and it is totally not doing it for me. I need something pretty to sleep to. maybe an explosions in the sky disc. or maybe godspeed. maybe damned astor piazolla. although with more listening I quite enjoy the "why" disc. it is so nice. it is a strange combination of ween like nonsense and slug like lyricism. kinda calm and yet I end up bobbing my head along with it. weird. it is called Oaklandazulasylum btw. wtf kind of name is that?<br></p>

<br>


<p>my parents are coming out pretty soon. it will be nice to see them. I think I am going to new york soon. I need to get out of my world. it will be nice. and then probably to colorado. and then hoepfully to india. and then hopefully dylan will come here in july. and hang out.<br></p>

<br>


<p>periods are the new commas, question marks and any other punctuation I randomly replace with periods.<br></p>

<br>


<p>unicorns are no longer the new black. the new black is once again black. black as the night. black as my once warm heart. haha.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i really think that bush has gone mad. seriously. also. it seems that maybe the media is starting to notice. it is pretty funny really.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i appreciate RSS readers. I like looking at the missed connections. via rss. it makes my "browsing" go a little easier. and a little quicker. so all you bastards that have blogs. update them.</p>

                <p>today everything I am wearing is either grey or black. even my underwear and socks. it is kinds funny. I didn't mrean to and I didn't really think about it until I was on the train. but yea. everything is grey. hah.<br></p>

<br>


<p>it is still sad out today. the weather is nice though. the sun. however it is cold. it is kinda how I feel right now.<br></p>

<br>


<p>last night morgan sent me an email that really made me feel better. of course I didn't get it until this morning - cuz I broke email again. haha. but I fixed it. but yea. it is funny how little words can make or break so much.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i am currently really into listening to "explosions in the sky." very good. exactly what I need. anything with vocals has the potential of invoking emotions which I don't really want to share with my work environment.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i really didn't want to get up today. I enjoyed my super weird dreams and soft blankets.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i think that today my goal is to try and buy a damned bike. I have attempted with failure for the last 2 days. hah. stupid christians and their "holidays." we all know it is a ploy to sell chocalate and jesus.<br></p>

<br>


<p>one of the things that is interesting about the last couple days. first off - nothing really went how I wanted it. since about wednesday. it all broke. haha. but starting yesterday - they started to patch themselves up. everything. it is like there was a flaw in the world of harper karma - and now it is coming back. sometimes when bad stuff happens it really makes you remember how lucky you are. overall. yea yea yea. <b>;)</b></p>

                <p>tonight was one of those times. where it all makes semse but it didn't make anything better or easier. only harder. but it will get better. I know it. in fact I feel better already about this one than I did about the last time. hah. so I guess I am a free agent. which I am not relaly happy about. I don't want to be a free agent. stupid agents. but I do think that this decision will lead to a better place for both morgan and myself. I just feel that soemtimes shit gets harder than I like it to. especially when relationships get ill.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i hate breaking up. more than almost anything else. it is sad<br></p>

<br>


<p>maybe I will buy a bike tomorrow. and ride it. maybe I will sleep all day and ignore my life for a second. I really want something to work out. it has been a really tough couple days. just something go right for a second. that is all I ask. maybe imap fixing itself woudl do it. but whatever. at this point I am not picky.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i could probably use a hug. or a pop. a hug would be better.</p>

                <p>so my l33t skills didn't work out today. I totally screwed up my servers. well not really. I am not on my new servers yet. I had to leave my old server in colo - which costs me a lot more money, and I had to use the switch- so I wasn't able to return it. it sucks. I am pretty pissed/upset. mostly cuz I wasn't able to pull it off. I mean. I didn't really prepare as well as I should have. but wahtever.<br></p>

<br>


<p>on a different note - I did install a firewall and a new webserver in my colo. so I will begin to migrate web and shit to the new servers. it should be done in a couple days. that is really cool. oar.net is sooo fast. hehe.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i have been on my feet for 6 hours and am really tired. I need a hug/nap/back massage/punch/rc car race.<br></p>

<br>


<p>doh.</p>

                <p>so I sent my boss notice today that I will be taking friday the 9th of april off. this means that I am officially upgrading my servers in the near future. this increases the stress level and my need to work. <b>;)</b> no more hanging out. haha. well a little hanging out. it won't take that much time really. I magically and with great luck configured my other box so upgrading should (<i><strong>should</strong></i>) be pretty straight forward. however - no upgrade is easy and straight forward. ;). I just ordered a switch. I am rebuilding my firewall. I am reevaluating whether or not I should leave my old box there as a shell. I am leaning against it. but it woudl be super super nice. heh. but it would also be expensive for a high bandwidth shell. when really. I already have one. so I will probably remove it. but whatever. we shall see.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i am pretty upset about my brash behavoir this weekend. heh. I wasn't a good friend really. it is weird. I guess everyone goes through those quick moments where they cross the line and regret what they said. it wasn't even that bad. or.. well.. the intention wasn't that bad. the outcome may or may not have been bad. eep.<br></p>

<br>


<p>well hopefully I will be eating soon. I am hungry. while my server is being reborn and detecting DHCP. I need to acquire some much needed sustenance.</p>

                <p>i just hate the fact that I am unable to use MMS.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i seriously need to save my money. I am always running out of money. wtf. I guess my fasion lifestyle I established when I was a baller doesn't transcend well to the non-baller status I am currently exhibiting. doh! or lack there of. :(<br></p>

<br>


<p>i say this rant as I prepare to go out to sushi and a <i>super</i> (hah) club with my friends later. it is going to be really fun. I think that the people who will be in attendence are: chris, claudia, virgin tears guys, hiromi, mark, matt, derek, kari, morgan and myself. it is gunna rule. &lt;3 clubs with friends. seirously. so much fun. we are supposed to meet at sushi wabi for dinner at around 9. which should be FULL of fun. a bucket.<br></p>

<br>


<p>so things with morgan seem to have cleared up a bit. it is nice. she came over and we just hung out and played games. exactly what I wanted to do. I really like her and it is nice that things have worked out for the better. last weekend was pretty sad - but I think it will make our relationship stronger. and more resilent to nuclear war. I hate nuclear war - however I love nucular war. Love.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i need to get a frame so we can mount my <a href="http://ironkungfu.com/wiki/index.php/picture%20frame%20ibook">ibook friend</a>. however I think I need to reinstall osx before that (mostly cuz I have to put the cdrom back in <b>;)</b>). I am really excited about it. I think it is going to turn out really well. if it looks at all like a picture I will be so happy. one of the things I have to figure out is how to remove all the power saving features from osX. so that the screen doesn't blank or anything. also I need to figure out how to control it. I am thinking about useing a <a href="http://www.keyspan.com/products/usb/remote/">infrared remote</a>. I think that would be awesome. but there is also always bluetooth. one of the funniest things about this project is how I have two audreys sitting in my room doing nothing. just chilling. wtf. haha. they could easily become internet terminals. haha. umm whatever. I wish I coudl get QNX to boot on the ibook. then it woudl be really really easy to create this app. or maybe linux. hmm. I guess I will have to invetigate a bit.<br></p>

<br>


<p>morgan has a hair show this weekend. I wonder what her hair will be like on sunday. heh. I LOVE crazy hair cuts. my new one is so awesome. its theme was "camaro." hah. it looks it. I almost have a crew cut with a mullet/rattail. hah. awesome.<br></p>

<br>


<p>speaking of camaros. I think I may still be getting one. I keep finding local ones for aroun 1200 and that seems reasonable. I am thinkign that I will sell my car and spend half of that money buying a camaro. then giving <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_6600&amp;img=Nokia6600%28022%29.jpg">morgan</a>, <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_6600&amp;img=Nokia6600%28023%29.jpg">matt</a> and joe free reign to "fix" it up. I just hope we don't have to add a t-top. that seems like it would be a pain.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i made a <a href="http://blogs.nata2.org/lite.php">lite version</a> of the <a href="http://blogs.nata2.org/">nata2 blogs</a> page for all yall with pdas, <a href="http://ironkungfu.com/wiki/index.php/sidekick">sidekicks</a> and cool <a href="http://ironkungfu.com/wiki/index.php/nokia%206600">cell phones</a>. so yea. I am a fan of divs and css. if only I was a designer and had skillz in the design field.<br></p>

<br>


<p>hah. if only I was a speller and had skillz in the spelling field.<br></p>

<br>


<p>so back to my new phone. I relaly like it. however I think the OS is a bit kludgy. it really annoys me. like startign the camera is not relaly instantaneous. for $400 it shoudl be damn fast. also - the selection of applications is a little ot be desired.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i wish a mobloging standard would emerge. I should start emailing people around the community. if we all adopted a way of mobloging with these phones - then maybe a good application will emerge and mobloging will be easy and fun. it could be xmlrpc based or whatever. right now I am using email - which works but I feel there HAS to be a better way to do it.<br></p>

<br>


<p>enough.</p>

                <p>so I came to work. it was nice to go outside. I guess moving is good. although it was tough leaving the comfort (and depression) of my room - it is worth it to be out of the realm of my wallowing.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i listened to the butthole surfers on the way to work. hairway to steven. such a great album. hah. and then the cars. how did the cars do that. I really don't know. sooo good. ok. so I have a bunch of meetings that are really gunna make me mad in about 15 minutes. so I gotta chill out. I bought breakfast today. hmm.<br></p>

<br>


<p>in my last post I had lost hope. hope is back a bit. I like hope. we are good friends. I think that is why I get hurt sometimes. heh. stupid hope.</p>

                <p>today was kinda rough. morgan and I had a discussion last night that ended with our pretty much breaking up. it sucks quite a bit. I really didn't mean for this to happen. and I don't really know if she did either. but I am also not sure if it is something that is reconciliable or if it is just a situation that sucks and will not become "fixed." the reasons are all valid, and rational. it seems that it was a timing issue - not anything to do with reality or anything that breakups are usually. it just sucked a lot for it to be on my birthday. like a lot. I have officially postponed my birthday until next sunday. to help with my own sanity.<br></p>

<br>


<p>morgan is coming over now. we are going to talk about all this I imagine. it is pertty hard to deal with. mostly just something that I don't want to deal with. yea know. not an inconvienience. just something that is not my favorite. in fact it is so far from my favorite that I hate it.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i went to brunch today with <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A03%3A21_birthday%20brunch">some friends</a>. it was a lot of fun. I am glad they dragged me out. I needed it so much. it was successful. what wasn't successful was going to a movie with hiromi. we went and saw <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/EternalSunshineoftheSpotlessMind-1130889/">Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</a> - which I really enjoyed but isn't the best movie to see while you are all broken up over a girl. hah. what luck. <b>;)</b>. it ruled nonetheless. well ruled is an interesting description. ok. I am going to lie down. I need to remember to eat. remind me.</p>

                <p>so I am going to make a post not on that topic. doh!<br></p>

<br>


<p>so morgan picked me up a copy of the <a href="http://www.economist.com/">economist</a>. the cover is seriously the <a href="http://www.dopeman.org/threetogo.jpg">best thing ever</a>. I think I might subscribe. I also want to subscribe to a military journal as well. I don't know what. probably something rather conservative. something like <a href="http://www.janes.com/">janes</a> - but on paper. and then maybe <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/about/index.html">Mother Jones</a>. oh and <a href="http://harpers.org">harpers</a> (have you noticed how almost everything named harper <a href="http://harpers.org/MostRecentIndex.html">rules</a>? I sure have). I really wish that all of this info was available in an embedded news reader in my glasses. I always end up destroying magazines. they are so fragil. heh.<br></p>

<br>


<p><a href="http://www.proxientunit.com">mike</a> is rightfully <a href="http://www.proxientunit.com/archives/000162.html">disturbed</a> by <a href="http://www.erotech-industries.com/">this (nsfw)</a>. weird eh. I love computers. and their friends.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i am seriously considering getting a bike. I think it would be fun to ride to work. and I woudl be in much better shape because of it. I am thinking of getting a hybrid - cuz I don't like skinny skinny tires. and I am thinking about dropping the gears to a bare bare minimum. also something not to expensive. so all you bike riders out there.. let me know what you think. I talked to my friend who lives and works near me. and she said that it wasn't that big of a deal. you sweat a lot - so you bring your clothes with you. but that it was nice. and terrifying. that is the part I am leery about. but I will get a helmet. it will rule.<br></p>

<br>


<p>ok I am hungry now. lunch time.</p>

                <p>so I went and got accupuncture last night. I think I am done for a bit. I originally went to alleviate some back pain I had gained from wrestling - however the back pain is gone. so wheni arrived yesterday I realized that I really had know ailments for her to manipulate. I was perfect. so the session ended up just being weird and boring I mean.. it isn't really suppsoed to be entertaining - but I got tired of it and was suddenly done. this coupled with my unusually high(apparently) pain threshold made for a strangely unpleasent experience. she kept doing these things and asking me if they hurt. heh. none of them ever hurt - however my back is relaly sore today. she warned me of that - but I was like "yeah yeah yeah." whatever. haha. the one thing that was shocking - is that she put a needle into my finger and it totally destroyed my hand in pain. it was madness. total madness. my mind stopping paying attention to reality for a second - enough time to render the pain as a spindly set of wires shooting up my arm. insane. after I exclaimed my concerns over the shooting/stabbing/destroying pain in my hand - she removed the needle and it was gone. score one nerves. score zero acupuncture.<br></p>

<br>


<p>one of the weirdest side effects of the acupuncture was the emotion weirdness that happens afterwards. hiromi had mentioned that she is super weird afterwards and I experienced this after the last session. but it is still pretty weird. for the most part I am a relatively levelheaded person. oh sure I am crazy sometimes - but overall I am not a sad person. however both times after my accupuncture I felt really low confidence and totally out of place and time. the accupuncturist women described it as being "stoned" - heh. I don't know about that but it certain is a bit disconcerting to know that when I come back from the weird "<a href="http://www.goodlifemagnets.com/acupuncture.gif">needle massage</a>" that I am going to be an emotional wreck for the next four hours.<br></p>

<br>


<p>heh. so anyway. last night I got back from the crazy with machine and hung out a bit at home. morgan called and then I called back and acted like a crazy person. seriously. I didn't make sense - and I wasn't able to form sentences. those two may be related. so I just chilled - then went to watusi to hang out and see people and drink beers. after beers we went home. it was a fun night. morgans friend leslie is fun.<br></p>

<br>


<p>my <b>birthday</b> is on <a href="http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/March%2021">sunday</a>. get me <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/registry.html/002-0276114-2914465?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;id=24TWA6NT9YXAS">gifts</a>.<br></p>

<br>


<p>today is totally a weird day. I keep nodding off at my desk. not really sleeping - just not existing. well.. ok sleeping. but only for a sec. it is really annoying. and we didn't really stay up that late. I mean maybe until 3:30am haha. but not until 5 or 6. ok delerium setting in. wait..<br></p>

<br>


<p>i often laugh at what becomes news worthy in our media. for instance: <a href="http://drudgereport.com/kerryid1.htm">Kerry unloaded italian mansion month he decided white house run</a>. wtf. why is this important. is it important because he was able to use some of the money to support his candidacy? the article doesn't really say - it just doesn't really make any sense why this is news worthy. UNLESS!! it is on the case of <a href="http://andrew_redux.blogs.com/redux/2004/02/john_kerry_anti.html">kerry being a communist</a> and owning overseas property which demonstrates his honest support of <a href="http://www.tradingwebspaces.com/archives/breakroom2.jpg">bin laden and the al qaeda</a>. I knew it.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i think it is disappointing to see the power that <a href="http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/8199068.htm?template=contentModules/printstory.jsp">jesus still has</a>. man religion is wack. I know so few <a href="http://mattroanwillkickyourass.com/">cool christians</a> that it makes me sad. I wonder though.. how is "the passion" different from chick's <a href="http://www.chick.com/catalog/videos/LOTW.asp">light of the world</a>. both are "truth." both contain interpretations of the <a href="http://www.bible-christian-heritage.co.uk/images/bible.9.jpg">christian bible</a>(versus the <a href="http://home.online.no/~corneliu/extreme.html">church of appliantology</a> bible). and both are made by evil men. well I guess the <a href="http://www.hkdvdmart.com/a1/dvdmart/image/chick.jpg">chick dvd</a> isn't really a movie. it is more of a slide show. but really - aren't both attempting to stir up some hate against the truth naysayers.. anyway. it is all pretty weird to me. I would vote for jesus if he were running against bush. that is for sure.<br>
<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;cid=519&amp;u=/ap/20040318/ap_on_re_us/college_hate_crime_1&amp;printer=1">this</a> is very interesting and not really very surprising. heh. scalia is insane. once I met him at college. we drank wine together and discussed the <a href="http://www.project2061.org/tools/sfaaol/chap1.htm">nature of science</a> and its <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/dept/HPST/SciMedOrg/presentations/AlliKraus/img013.jpg">relationship to religion</a> - from a catholic point of view. hah. he didn't say "<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2004-02-06-cheney-scalia_x.htm">quack</a>" once. which was too bad. I would have liked to talk duck with him.<br></p>

<p>i wonder how long we can act like <a href="http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/columns/shoptalk_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000465506">this</a> isn't a problem. I would guess a long time. we have <a href="http://www.washtimes.com/national/20040317-105827-1441r.htm">lots</a> of other <a href="http://news.myway.com/top/article/id/256517|top|03-18-2004::10:04|reuters.html">things</a> to <a href="http://www.eubusiness.com/afp/040318101927.gsn430bz">think about</a>.<br></p>

<br>


<p>oh check out this site I made the other day: <a href="http://www.swampsugar.net">swampsugar.net</a>. I like it. it looks good. has a good theme and works well in almost all browsers. I didn't test netscape 4.7. mostly because I hate netscape 4.7. hate is a strong word - and is appropriately used when refering to the <a href="http://www.hobbytyme.com/mdse/ver1444.jpg">devil incarnate</a> that is netscape 4.7.<br></p>

<br>


<p>whew. ok. I get a haircut tonight. I am looking a little <a href="http://www.nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/photolog/1079548717-t610%282%29.jpg">rough</a>. heh. ok. I feel better. I think I need to take tonight off. maybe hang with my roomies. or maybe morgan. but NOT go out. even though the assassins are playing (although I should be boycotting them wtf) and I woudl see all my friends. I think I just need to sit on the couch and veg. heh. maybe goto a movie. just remain unmoved. soemthing. my fingers are out of control. they won't let me stop typing.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i REALLY want my new phone. it is supposed to be delievered today. TODAY I tell you. oh and myspace profiles are unprotected. heh. check it out: <a href="http://www.myspace.com/247819.usr">mine</a>, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/383329.usr">brocks</a> and <a href="http://www.myspace.com/813235.usr">morgans</a>. weird eh.

                <p>omg I am a bit hung over. I am not even a lot hung over. I just don't usually get hung over - so when I am - I am a baby about it. last night was a mess. it ruled. jon went out with friends - so kayne and I went to a art opening at heaven. there were some pretty good photographs and the like - it was nice. I saw a <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1079148036-t610(1).jpg">bunch of people</a> I don't usually see out, which is always nice. after that we went to a skater party at this awesome space on the soutside. it had a <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1079159102-t610(1).jpg">half pipe in the living room</a>. it was really insane. I miss skaters. it was the same "type" of person I hung out with in high school. which was awesome - especially since both <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1079164000-t610(1).jpg">jon</a> and <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1079163948-t610(2).jpg">kayne</a> were here. we hung out for a long time there and eventually made it to the northside for a show at the metro/smartbar. at smartbar there were these amazing djs from cologne. they were impressive. upstairs at metro there was a drum and bass show (which is pretty funny - because I used to spin drum and bass in college for the radio I worked for). it was awesome. I used to be really into shy fx and the like. I miss that. but I don't really miss it.. if you know what I mean. heh. we then came home and hung out in my room showing jon all the music that he has missed in the last year. that was awesome. awesome awesome awesome.<br></p>

<br>


<p>so I was telling morgan awhile agothat I really only have 50 or so words in my vocabulary. it is sorta boring. I need to gain the ability to use more than 50 words a day. I mean I can repeat them but I apparently can't go over 50. heh. stupid 50. someday I will learn. someday. it will rule. RULE I say.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i really don't know what today will bring. there are some tentative plans to play games tonight. which woudl be nice. it is always super entertaining and funny. hopefully matiss will play. that guy is so fun. haha. but unfortuantly he is ditching us for a lady. hahaha. hehehe. I love it. anyway. I should hang out. now.</p>

                <p>So today some terrorists in the basque region of spain <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/11/international/europe/11CND-TRAI.html?hp">blew up a bunch of commuter trains during rush hour</a>. this is after the E.T.A. declared a cease fire on the caralina region of spain - so apparently the terrosist actions are now concentrated on madrid and the like.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i know so little about the france/spain/basque conflict that I am very confused. it is interesting to read the reactions of the internet to such a horrible terrorist act. I was specifically interested in what <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1006663.html">Russell Beattie</a> would say - as he worked in spain for awhile doing tech stuff and has a seemingly good political stance. I also stumled upon a bunch of spanish blogs and newsfeeds that helped a lot. here are some links:</p>

<blockquote><small><a href="http://www.basque-red.net/eng/revoleng/revoleng.htm">is revolution growing in basque country</a><br>

<p>It is hard to view this objectively or in a form that woudl understand the political or social motivatio nfor participating and executing such an attack. I really feel that terrorism obviously has its place in the path to revolution and change - but it is difficult to agree with that stance when you see the ramifications of terrorism effecting your daily life. we all witnessed this with sept. 11th and now spain is dealing with it on a scale new to them as well. so what should a group of people do when confronted with this situation. react back? react against whom though - the "E.T.A" has not claimed responsibility - we know from oklahoma city bombing that it could easily be a small malaligned group of people who have the same political motivations as the E.T.A. but are not associated. this sucks for the E.T.A. because it blows there attempts at gaining a cease fire or some assemblence of peace. and then conversely - if it were the E.T.A. why would they be doing this a week before the spanish elections - they probably won't cause people to vote pro-basque out of fear. I suppose they coudl scare politicians into acting a certain way. but I don't know.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i am interested in seeing how the world reacts to these very publicized atacks in this age of "anti-terror." is the U.S. gunna come help? - hah. is bush going to react? I wonder.<br></p>

                <p>after walking to work. I noticed that I generally feel pretty good - in regards to the stiffness and all the reasons I went to accupuncture. that seems pretty cool.<br></p>

<br>


<p>on the elevator up to work there was a sign on the thirteenth floor that had a biohazard symbol and a birthday cake. I wasn't able to read it - I was confused by the combination of those icons. maybe not so much confused as I was worried. heh. umm. biowarfare cakeclass. that is the name of my new band btw. I am gunna play guitar.<br></p>

<br>


<p>this whole gay marriage thing is stupid. I don't understand how bush and "the republicans" can be so pigheaded and stupid. how can they actively be supporting such a segregationist movement. it is <a href="http://conelrad.com/">pretty insane</a>. a couple good links: <a href="http://www.wilwheaton.net/mt/archives/001544.php">wil wheatons writeup</a> and then <a href="http://www.oneeyedcult.com/archives/000036.html">Cult of the One Eyed Cat</a>. both argue that the government shoudl not be involved. I guess it ust demonstrates the need to remove general religious morality from our government leadership. this should not be a truth issue - this shoudl be an issue of rights. a social issue - not a morality issue. another interesting way to look at this situation is to take into consideration the <a href="http://www.corante.com/importance/archives/002111.html">The Anti-Miscegenation Amendment</a> - which is an amendment from 1912 that attempted to abolish interracial marriage on the ground that it is "<i>..abhorrent and repugnant. It is subversive to social peace. It is destructive of moral supremacy..</i>" awesome eh. <b>;)</b> I think the point that can be taken from this - is that we all look at 1912 and see this ammendment and we think "how ridiculous, they were insane and obviosuly racist" - and then we think how silly and backwards the people who created the ammendment are. but what is missing - is that bush and his henchmen are the same people. they are conservative, upperclass white people - attempting to sell the voters out to big business. they are not caring about the actual issue. they are caring about whether they will continue being in public office - and what the means are to maintain that power: i.e. money. now I don't think that it is just a money/corporate/lalala issue - it is obviously based on some "moral truth" that is "wrong" hahaha. what I mean to say is that there is a "moral truth" backing this new anti gay marriage ammendment that is appealing to a lot of americans - regardless of the social and segragationist implications. since <a href="http://godlovesfags.com/">god hate gays</a>, <a href="http://liberalslikechrist.org/gopvsgay.jpg">godlovers hate gays</a>. truth is hard to defeat and bush knows this. I am rambling a bit. heh. however I guess my overall point is that we need to keep in mind the viewpoint of disallowing any social/economic/ethnic/sexuality/etc group of people from doing ANYTHING is segragationist and is a process of creating a subclass of human. it seems that this is somethign that the US is constantly trying to combat around the world - how are we gogn to let this happen here? bush is dumb.</p>

                <p>so this weekend was pretty fun. on friday I hung out with morgan and we went to a art opening at my friend <a href="http://www.redrocketgallery.com">lenores gallery</a>. the opening was fun - but the hanging out was really good. after this event, we went to a party where a pinata filled with cayan pepper was exploded prior to our arrival. it was rather abrasive on my poor nasal passage ;). we hung out here and drank rather rough gin drinks until we got hungry enough to leave. we ate at clarks and we acted like we were straightedge. it ruled.<br></p>

<br>


<p>Sooo. valentines day was quite fun. I met morgan at the train (after apparently almost getting mugged by the most lackadaisical mugger: I just said no) and we went to the <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fholidays%2Fvalentines_04">monster truck rally</a>. it was really fun. a perfect valentines date. it ruled. I liked <a href="http://www.gravedigger.com">gravedigger</a> the best ;).the strangest part were all the little kids without ear plugs. so sad. a couple of them were obviously uncomfortable. so after the monster truck rally - we went to morgans house and hung out with my roommate matt, alan, colby, felice and morgans roomates:jeremy and tanya. we hung out, ate cheese, and drank margaritas and beers. it was fun. eventually we played the word game. which was quite fun - because everyone is interested in spelling. then everyone left.<br></p>

<br>


<p>and it suddenly was morning. today I was really off in regards to my bodies feelings.. .heh.. I basically watched movies and slept ALL day. it ruled. I imagine I will goto sleep soon.. and then wake up refreshed. I do need to buy some decongetants or whatever.<br></p>

<br>


<p>today my friend told me how he met bill gates. I think that is insane. he could buy all his friends and his families lives with very very little work. that is screwed up. hah. anyway. I am watching a movie..so this whole entry probably doesn't make a damn bit of sense. but whatever. I am the roxor.</p>

                <p>so a week or so ago I went to this party for the <a href="http://www.chicagothong.org/">chicago thong organization</a>, it was really funny and strange - but my friend chris and I participated in the activities and wore thongs and capes(which was the costume of choice). well later that night we were at a club and one of our friends snapped this really great <a href="http://ambrel.net/android/images/IMG_1453.jpg">shot of my ass</a>. when I got to work on monday and saw it - I thought immediately how fun(and funny) it would be to send it to my parents in a really nice frame. so I did. it was killing me however - cuz I had to wait quietly in the corner and let them receive it without me blowing the surprise. so today they receieved it. ;) and here is my fathers response (via aim of course):</p>

<p>hopefully I will receive my <a href="http://danger.com/">sidekick today</a>. I am hopeing to <a href="http://ironkungfu.com/wiki/index.php/sidekick">hacking it</a> with the goal being to write some really nifty apps for it. mostly network security tools and blogging utils. I really like the idea of using it only for AIM. hah. I will continue to become a huge nerd. <a href="http://stuffthatisawesome.tripod.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/gatesmug.jpg">HUGE NERD</a>. speaking of random linking, check out my friend <a href="http://virtualdarts.typepad.com/">boone's new blog</a>. he has really taking to blogging with great style and <a href="http://www.studio7imaging.com/images/ultra_fractals/pizazz.jpg">pizazz</a> (that was a tribute link <b>;)</b>). I think I would like to write a small piece of code into my blog that will link to specific words I define with random images from googles image search. I think that would be entertaining.</p>

                <p>hehe. so I just back from <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1075750273-t610(1).jpg">the doctor</a> - my annual checkup I guess. I don't often go but in light of seeing my family get sick and then better I decided awhile ago that I woudl take a more proactive approach to my health. which.. may or may not involve moving a bit more - I think moving is stupid.<br></p>

<br>


<p>my weekend effects have yet to peak:</p>

<p>oh yea.<br>
today is ending up to be a bad day. I just want to go home and sleep. often when I party all weekend with my friends I get up at 3-5 and gotobed around 3-5. that is not a good schedule to try and switch on the fly with the corp. world schedule. stupid corp. world. I want to wear jeans.</p>

                <p>so today I had a weird day at work. nothing happened - I just felt weird. so I went home and attempted to take a nap to relax myself. but that didn't work. I couldn't sleep. I needed to just screw around or hang out and say stupid shit to people. so I got matt and we walked to the local bar. it ruled. we drank $20 worth of beer - which on an empty stomach is PLENTY. but anyway. matt and I hugn out until about 8. which was a great time. totally chilled me out. we just talked trash about our lives until we were bored - which is exactly what I needed. after that I went to dinner in wicker park with morgan. I was a bit tipsy - so I hung out with the homeless guys first. I told them jokes. bad jokes. they even dissed my delivery ;) it ruled. then I went home, first buying candy. I am now drinking a assload of dr. pepper. and will soon move on to the sour patch kids and or skiddles. I am working tonight - load testing. so now that I am sober I need to stay awake. haha. my life rules.<br></p>

<br>


<p>My friend thom rules. I like talking to him.</p>

                <p>So my friend and best fan in taiwan, <a href="http://home.kimo.com.tw/pzantique/">ella</a>, met with my roommate hiromi in taiwan. I sent a care package with hiromi for ella. she seemed to like her a care package - which is good.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i hung out with morgan again last night. it was fn. we hung out with matt and edie and some of their friends. they played a bunch of games.. I showed morgan my yoyo work. it is funny - cuz I am sooooo nerdy.. yet strangely I feel the need to parade my nerdiness around like a rockstar, which is what I am. I have fans. ;)<br></p>

                <p>So I have been trashing my blog by quoting aim and such. it is nice and humorous but it totally throughs of the blog feel and makes it kinda childish. I really don't like it. but I am still laughignabout this prank I pulled on my friend scott - so I will share it with yall.. it is the last one for awhile.. (unless I continue to be awesome)<br></p>

<br>


<p>So the setup was that I wanted to play a joke on scott. I was posting random stuff to friendster and I came up with the idea of posting scotts cell phone number to friendster as a "dial a song." so I did it. here is my post:</p>

<blockquote><small>check out all the new chicago music by calling<br>
chicagos new dial-a-song. call:<br>
8xx-xxxxx-x0<br>
it rules...<br></small></blockquote>


<p>I posted it and waited a long time. it sucked. I hate waiting. I thin I could never go to war... cuz the waiting would bother me.. not the killing.. ;) I eventually broke down and told broox about it:</p>

<blockquote><small><b>Derek R Brooks (2:08:26 PM):</b> hahaha<br>
<b>Derek R Brooks (2:08:38 PM):</b> i'm calling it<br>
<b>linUXkilla (2:08:38 PM):</b> funney eh ;-)<br>
<b>linUXkilla (2:08:40 PM):</b> haha<br>
<b>linUXkilla (2:08:42 PM):</b> don't tell<br>
<b>Derek R Brooks (2:10:03 PM):</b> I called it<br>
<b>linUXkilla (2:10:13 PM):</b> what happened<br>
<b>Derek R Brooks (2:10:18 PM):</b> voicemail<br>
<b>Derek R Brooks (2:10:30 PM):</b> I asked if there was anything new in the chicago music scene<br></small></blockquote>


<p>and then about 5 minutes later I got this from scott:</p>

<blockquote><small><b>phunktoad (2:15:02 PM):</b> what the<br>
<b>phunktoad (2:15:08 PM):</b> I just got a call on my cell phone<br>
<b>linUXkilla (2:15:24 PM):</b> ?<br>
<b>phunktoad (2:15:26 PM):</b> "hey... I was just calling to see whats up with the chicago music scene, seeing if there's any new artists out there"<br>
<b>phunktoad (2:06:30 PM):</b> "alright, bye"<br>
<b>linUXkilla (2:06:56 PM):</b> wtf<br>
<b>phunktoad (2:07:01 PM):</b> right<br></small></blockquote>


<p>and then finally he found out:</p>

<blockquote><small><b>phunktoad (3:17:56 PM):</b> harper<br>
<b>phunktoad (3:17:58 PM):</b> I hate you so much<br>
<b>linUXkilla (3:17:59 PM):</b> yea<br>
<b>linUXkilla (3:18:00 PM):</b> hahaha<br>
<b>phunktoad (3:18:18 PM):</b> god damnit<br>
<b>linUXkilla (3:18:38 PM):</b> I rule<br>
<b>phunktoad (3:18:58 PM):</b> I should have read that whole message<br>
<b>linUXkilla (3:19:32 PM):</b> I removed the post<br>
<b>phunktoad (3:22:23 PM):</b> ass<br>
<b>phunktoad (3:22:25 PM):</b> I was like<br>
<b>phunktoad (3:22:34 PM):</b> what the fuck, why are all these people calling me<br>
<b>linUXkilla (3:22:59 PM):</b> did lots of people call?<br>
<b>phunktoad (3:26:15 PM):</b> at least 6<br>
<b>linUXkilla (3:28:44 PM):</b> nice<br></small></blockquote>

<p>it is shocking that nata2.info is rated as 118378. I didn't expect to be rated so hi. it is surprising especially since it is cobbled together and has a bunch of very person pictures on it. I wonder how many people stumble across it and end up looking at picture of me and my friends.. heh. how fun.</p>

<p>i am tired and hungry. mostly hungry.

<br>


<p>phillip torrone's <a href="http://www.philliptorrone.com/option3/">project</a> to take a picture every thirty minutes turned out really cool. I wish I woudl have stuck with my idea of taking pictures of everything I ate. it didn't really go over that well. mostly cuz the day I started I happened to be at a resturant/bar and it was more bar than resturant and I kept taking sloppy pictures. stupid pictures..<br></p>

<p>soemday I will get my new servers up.</p>

Then we all went ice skating.. well we didn't actually go ice skating - we went to an <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1071968264-t610(1).jpg">figure skating show</a>. it was quite something. a friend of my family was in it - she was good. the figure skating was in the "<a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1071968264-t610(1).jpg">natatorium</a>." heh. I don't quite know if I enjoy figure skating as of yet. I imagine I will figure that out soon enough. after the figure skating.. we went to a <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1071990746-t610(1).jpg">fancy party</a> dressed as future people.<br></p>

<br>


<p>on sunday - we all hung out around the house and cooked. we made candy and peanut brittle and all sorts of goodies. I cut myself twice on the candy.. :( but that is ok ;)<br></p>

<br>


<p>so last night I stayed up and made a opml reader - mostly cuz I wanted to be able to easily read all my favorite websites without a lot of work or even effort. so chekc it out <a href="http://dopeman.org/opmld/">here</a>. it is in the same vein as the <a href="http://dopeman.org/klip/">.klip maker</a> I made. hopefully it works for all. I did notice it didn't work for a couple. but whatever ;)<br></p>

<br>


<p>soon I will be adding trackbacks and possibly comments to this blog. maybe. maybe not.<br></p>

<br>


<p>eep!</p>

                <p>So my mobile phone fascination has reached a new height. I took some spare time in the last couple days and compiled a phon/mobile/technology blog. check it out <a href="http://www.3gcoding.com">here</a>. Hopefully it will continue to foster exciting phone stuff for my head. and make me a million dollar bills.<br></p>

<br>


<p>last night I watched pirates of the caribbean again and played a BUNCH of video games. it was fun but I really needed to work more. it sucks. I sometimes hate that I am not the taskmaster I need to be. doh! stupid wondering mind. I really need to finish the cholo site and I need to finish my servers. jesus I need to finish my servers. heh. I think I am going to add trackback functionality into my nata2.org blog. I really like all of the fancy features you can do with trackback and technocrati or whatever. someday. I will be a blog god. hahaha. stupid internet. never getting me a girlfriend.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i am really excited to get my <a href="http://www.ambient411.com">ambient</a> <a href="http://www.ambientdevices.com/cat/orb/orborder.html">orb</a> hooked up and working. I am not sure what I will have it monitor. probably homeland securitythe weather, my servers and of course my friendster messages. hahahah. wait wait. I got it. I will have it monitor the homeland security thing and ambient my tivo's themes - which will msg my phone.. to tell me when to duck from a bomb. awesome. I rule!<br></p>

<br>


<p>i goto colorado again really soon. weird! but this time with hiromi so that will be awesome...<br></p>

<br>


<p>a friend who recently got hooked on blogs turned me onto <a href="http://www.sharpreader.net/">sharpreader</a> which really makes reading blogs fun. it uses the .net framework so it is kinda sketchy - but other than that it rules. oh yea.. rules!! check it out.</p>

                <p>today I get to go home. unfortunantly tomarrow I have to go back to work. it was quite nice not working - but all things must end and back to work I go. I will strangely be coming right back to chicago come friday. whee. this time hiromi will be coming so that should be fun.<br></p>

<br>


<p>my father is <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&amp;img=1071429421-t610(4).jpg">out of the hospital</a> as of this afternoon. that is nice and refreshing. I am sure he is super happy to be back home - able to shower in his shower, sleep in his bed, eat his food.. etc etc. we are all very happy that it turned out well.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i am tired. I stayed up until 6:00 last night working on stuff for the <a href="http://www.saveamerica.nl">save america</a> people. it isn't done yet. but soon. I just have to budget my time better. I didn't do very well these past couple days. but I guess that makes since.. as I was busy with family stuff.. and such ;)<br></p>

<br>


<p>last night I picked up the alien box set.. something quadrology -heh. it rules. there are NINE dvds. it extends like 7 ft or something. I am happy. so with that, pirates of the carribean and the new LOTR: return of the king - this week is gunna rule the movies.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i have to go and shower, pack, clean, run errands for my folks.. then I gotta drive my truck (hahaha I have a truck) to the airport and fly to chicago. wheee...</p>

                <p>So yesterday my fathers surgery went without a hitch and he now has a cyborg heart. it rules - mainly cuz his un-cyborg heart was full of badnesss so it would have not been so keen on working much longer. cyborg parents are all the rage I hear. So anyway.. he is doing great. almost all the tubes are out. and he is sleepy.<br></p>

<br>


<p>it is weird though.. the move from immortal parents to immortal kids. it seems that somewhere around 20-25 (of course a sliding age) the parents pass on this idea of immortality to their children. umm<br></p>

<p>i have a LOT of work to do tonight.</p>

<p>on saturday my parents left. I was sad. but I get to go and see them soon. which will be nice. I will be in colorado for a week - then I will be back in chicago for a week. then back in colorado. I think.... anyway.. on saturday my friends and I were bored... so I went and bought a <a href="http://www.nintendogamecube.com/">gamecube</a> and a couple of <a href="http://www.mariokart.com/launch/index.html">fun</a> <a href="http://www.marioparty.com/">party</a> games. The best part about it all is the <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/gcnlarge?gallery=accessory&amp;currentNo=5">wireless controllers</a> - seriously.. so awesome. next is the broadband <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/gcnlarge?gallery=accessory&amp;currentNo=7">connector</a>.. then with the help of phantasy star.. freedom.. and a homebrew dev system ;)<br></p>

                <p>This weekend was insane. as you may be able to tell from the crazy blog entries. I was a madperson. So.. on saturday I went to quad cities juggle fest. it was a lot of fun. I hung out with mark and some nice jugglers from carleton college. we juggled a bunch. I love juggling with little kids - who are as good as I am. hah. at five or so I went to the theatre with mark.. and hung out with the performers a bit. then <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fholidays%2Fhalloween_2003&amp;img=halloween_crazy%20013.jpg">derek</a> and <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fholidays%2Fhalloween_2003&amp;img=halloween_crazy%20012.jpg">kevin</a> came and we got dinner. after dinner was the <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fholidays%2Fhalloween_2003&amp;img=halloween_crazy%20014.jpg">show</a> which we watched. After the show we went to Mt. Vernon(where my <a href="http://www.cornellcollege.edu">alma mater</a> is) and hung out. I hung out with derek and his gf(who is really cool) and generally chilled out. While at the bar I ran into a really <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fholidays%2Fhalloween_2003&amp;img=halloween_crazy%20017.jpg">old friend</a> who I hadn't really hung out with since 6th or 8th grade. we all left the bar and helled about campus - drinking on tarr roof, hangin out in the dorms and <a href="http://nata2.info/pictures/holidays/halloween_2003/halloween_crazy%20022.avi">just generally causing a ruckus</a>. it was fun. I then made my way back to derek's gfs house - where we were staying. I woke up at 11:30 or 12 and we headed back to the quad cities. I juggled a bit and yoyoed a bunch. mark and I headed out and I got back to chicago aruond 10.<br></p>

<br>


<p>at 10 I had a meeting for work. this is where the craziness started. my coworkers and I met from 10pm until 3:30am. at this time it was decided that I should go to the office and fix some shit. so I went to the office. I coudln't figure out how to turn the damn lights on( I finally figured it out). and I attempted to fix shit. so then I met with everyone from 8-2:30. I got home at 3 and crashed until 7:30am this morning. and that is where I am now. a bit weak from not eating.. but generally rested.<br></p>

<br>


<p>so in summary.. I worked 18hrs straight and then slept 17hrs. I rule.<br></p>

<br>


<p>I got my tivo last night.. so hopefully I will be playing with it tonight. I gotta <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=misc/misc_hacking&amp;text=DTivo%20Hacking%20FAQ.txt">figure</a> it out though.<br></p>

<br>

                <p>However.. this time is a lot more pleasant. All I do is get tired when I run over 1 mile and sleep when I lay in my bed. oh.. and I also have the sniffles. but I am going to take some medicine.. and a E-merge-ENC-E. it will be a nice cocktail.<br></p>

<br>


<p>So us IT workers have been complaining to the building manager that we need mountain dew in our damned pop machine. he just looks at us and laughs. until now. this morning mountain dew appeared where the fruit punch used to be.. however.. it is a ruse.. because when you stick in your hard earned $0.40 a fruit punch comes out. infernal machines.. always tricking us humans.<br></p>

<br>


<p>last night I went to <a href="http://www.sushisamba.com">sushi samba</a>. it was good.. but expensive. the atmosphere was interesting.. the clientel seemed to be all coked out of their minds.. and mostly suits. it was annoying. but the place is incredible looking inside.<br></p>

<br>


<p>the most important thing to happen recently is launching my new website: <a href="http://www.weownthesun.com">weownthesun.com</a>. that is right. I am part of a group that owns the sun. WE OWN THE SUN. it is exciting to be one of the largest land owners in the world/universe. we have some great sponsorship and we love the world.</p>

                <p>Friday I about died from hunger. I got home from work.. .actually .. I didn't really get home form work. I went straight to atomix coffee shop and met dylan and hiromi.. also.. rachel, hans, marcia and nicole were all there. so it was awesome. we then hurried home and went to heat. heat was intense. we got a live fish and a bunch of really good sushi. I think that it was good. but it wasn't worth the price the extra money they asked. I think it might have been better if we had gone to sushi wabi... but the live fish was <a href="http://nata2.info/pictures/events/dylan_and_meghan_visits_10_03/dylans%20visit%20002.jpg">AWESOME</a>. it was insane. we watched it die.. and then we ate it 20 minutes later. heh. crazy. dylan LOVED it.<br></p>

<br>


<p>on saturday we hung out and had GREAT italian food. <a href="http://nata2.info/pictures/events/dylan_and_meghan_visits_10_03/dylans%20visit%20014.jpg">Meghan visited</a> and it was very nice to see her. dylan was really funny.. so we played a good trick on him.. hehe.<br></p>

<br>


<p>today.. we got up late.. got lunch and juggled near the lake.. then we went to marks house and played dinner.<br></p>

<br>


<p>now it is time for sleep.... ahhhhhhhh... sleeeeeeeep...</p>

                <p>so everyday for the past couple days I have been meaning to update my site. but I keep getting interupted or cool stuff happens and I am like ahh.. "later."<br></p>

<br>


<p>soo.. on thursday my friends and I went to <a href="http://www.brujeria.com/">brujeria</a> at the aragon. it was incredible. the concert was apparently a mexican death metal festival - so there were a lot of bands. we got there at like 7 and the <a href="http://www.brujeria.com/">brujeria</a> didn;t start until 12. I was tired. but the show was soo awesome. <a href="http://www.brujeria.com/">brujeria</a> has a "hit" song called "<a href="http://www.lyrics.net.ua/song/9770">matando gueros</a>" which in english means "kill whitey." heh. it was pretty strange. but the band is so good. so it didn't matter.<br></p>

<br>


<p>Mike left on friday. it was pretty fun to have him around. on friday hiromi an I hung out and went to a phillip glass show <a href="http://www.koyaanisqatsi.org/">koyaanisqatsi</a> at the chicago theatre. it was quite nice. kinda silly.. that minimalist crap is silly. but I liked it. and then we went to a middled eastern resturant called <a href="http://entertainment.metromix.chicagotribune.com/top/1,1419,M-Metromix-Bars-!PlaceDetail-7357,00.html">souk</a>. it ruled. there was a belly dancer and a live band.. and rather good food. it was nice. I love good food. then we went to a couple parties.<br></p>

<br>


<p>on saturday I slept in and then went shopping.. I couldn't really find anything so I gave up and went home.. but I found hiromi on the way home and we hung out.. then.. last night <a href="http://www.therats.org">matiss</a>, lenore, <a href="http://www.markhayward.net">mark</a> and myself all went to my friend <a href="http://www.equulei.com/">james'</a> party. it was a funny party. we then went to the signature lounge and attempted to have dessert. heh. it didn't work out. cuz.. they stop serving dessert after 12. stupid signature lounge..<br></p>

<br>


<p>ahhh.. now it is time to start another week. wheee..</p>

                <p>So this weekend was rather nice. On friday, some friends and I went and saw <a href="http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/onceuponatimeinmexico/">once upon a time in mexico</a>. it was really fun. I love johnny depp. there was a lot of crazy violence. it was insane. blown knees and all. then hiromi, lavi and I went to dinner. hiromi and I went and visited marcia - but we were all so tired. so we went home. I was asleep by 12 oclock on friday. it ruled. I slept until way late on saturday and then went to my friend <a href="http://www.127th.com">bryans</a> for a bbq. I love bbqs. they seem to bring out a lot of fun in people. I had these little <a href="http://www.millertime.com/about_highlife.jsp">7oz miller high life</a> bottles that were the hit of the party. that night was coles party.. so we had primer margaritas, polishing off the remaining petron, and got ready to go. Coles party was really great. there were an ass load of people there.. and it ended up being super dope. a worlds colliding type of dope. <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures/events/last_party_ever">here</a> are some pictures.. <a href="http://www.ifd-lab.com/temp/sometimes/sometimes.html">here are more</a>. The party didn't really stop until early early in the morning. it was fun. a bunch(2) of coworkers were there.. it was great. sunday... I just chillled out. watched old school. played server. etc etc.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i also.. <a href="http://football.fantasysports.yahoo.com/f1/show?page=matchup&amp;lid=361151&amp;week=2&amp;mid1=10&amp;mid2=2">won</a> fantasy football. total chance.</p>

                <p>heh. so this irc channel has totally made for fun times. I hooked up <a href="http://corp.dopeman.org">this</a> to log everything and especially links.. hehe. it rules. but whatever. the only problem is that it doens't log the bot - which will be annoying.. especially when we play trivia.. which you are all invited to participate in. btw.. trivia rules.<br></p>

<br>


<p>this weekend.. was dope. <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fparties%2Fkill_hannah_afterparty&amp;img=kill%20hannah%20afterparty%20004.jpg">we hung out</a> in wicker park for this crazy block party. it was not as good as other block parties I have been too - but their were a lot of dope people. some good bands.. a good dj.. yea know.. lavi had a fashion show.. it was good stuff.. indeed<br></p>

<br>


<p>after this - <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fparties%2Fkill_hannah_afterparty&amp;img=kill%20hannah%20afterparty%20008.jpg">we went</a> to the <a href="http://www.killhannah.com">kill hannah</a> show and hung out. Kill hannah is a fun band to see in concert. the crowd LOVES them. LOVES with a capital G. anyway.. after the show we went to watusi and chilled out. <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fparties%2Fkill_hannah_afterparty&amp;img=kill%20hannah%20afterparty%20013.jpg&quot;">tommie was spinning</a>.. after watusi we went to harry's velvet room for some DJ action.. as you can see.. <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fparties%2Fkill_hannah_afterparty&amp;img=kill%20hannah%20afterparty%20046.jpg">it was a gooooood party</a>.<br></p>

<br>


<p>today matiss and I juggled for a kids bday party. it was nice.. kids. are sometimes mean.. but these kids were great. a couple of them were very intelligent. heh.</p>

                <p>seriously.. it was incredible. I finally was able to get my cyberarts book. it is so funny to be in a fancy book. I mean I know I won, but I didn't expect it to be such a fancy book. or a book that was actually at a store... and real. it is weird. I look at my picture and am like.. woah.. I am famous. haha. well not really.. but sorta. heh.<br></p>

<br>


<p>tonight I went to spybar and as I left. I saw this HUGE pole fall onto incoming traffic at the 90/94 on ramp on ontario. it was INSANE. a HUGE pole. it crashed and went accross the ENTIRE street. so of course I ran over there to survey the damage. right as we ran (me and some homeless guys) a couple cars jumped the pole and crashed. it was insane. so we got to the pole and all traffic was stopped. so we grabb ed the pole and four of us pulled it out of the street. then I caught a cab and came home.<br></p>

                <p>so yesterday I read two books. it was madness. I just needed that stimulation I guess.. first I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0671027360/nata2productions">Angels &amp; Demons</a> by Dan Brown. It was pretty good. a very nice read. I felt that it was similar to those science/medical fiction books that are use a hihg base level of knowledge about the subject... the jargon I guess.. however Brown's book is about catholicism, the vatican and such.. which makes it really fun to read - since I studied all of that crap in college. I guess it is like a trashy novel for an intellectual history/history of cathalocism buff.. hehe. I am going to start his other book: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345451511/nata2productions">the davinci code</a> next.<br>
Soon after I finished Angels &amp; Demons.. I did a bit of work.. and then needed to SLEEP. so to chill myself out I started reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743225708/nata2productions">Bringing Down the House</a>. this is a book about MIT students who used math and such to develop a sure fire way to count cards. it was fun. quick easy. but it left a bit of the nitty gritty out of the story. I wanted to hear about the strippers.. and all the nastiness of vegas. it was insane though. I am always interested in stories where ultra young people because uber rich. ;)<br></p>

<br>


<p>so.. having stayed up til 4 reading books. ugh. I am now tired. oh so tired. need caffeine<br></p>

<br>


<p>apparently <a href="http://www.audreyhacking.com">Audreyhacking</a> is featured in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/3775712089/nata2productions">this book</a>. BUY IT!!</p>

                <p>as per usual.. a bunch of stuff is happening...<br></p>

<br>


<p><a href="http://www.abcnews.go.com/wire/US/reuters20030723_3.html">North Korea</a> has given a date to the U.S. to resolve its problems with N. Koreas nuclear arms.. woah.. I guess we should really <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/942734.asp?0dm=T14QT">learn about earth</a> before the N. koreans and the U.S. <a href="http://www.trumpetersmission.com/faqrev1998.html">blow it up</a>..<br></p>

<br>


<p>the weapons inspector from the U.K. that killed himself.. is shown in <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1004177,00.html">a tape</a> criticising blair's need for evidence to support his false claim of WMD in Iraq.<br></p>

<br>


<p>heh.. and even Bill Clinton is siding with Bush about his <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/07/23/clinton.iraq.sotu/">apparent mistake</a> in the state of the union. wtf. didn't he lie.. I guess clinton is just happy that bush <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A45241-2003Jul11.html">really</a> is in a free fall..<br></p>

<br>


<p>so there is this attacker in wicker park.. it is insane.. but apparently the police released a report that stated that the attacked <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/output/news/cst-nws-cube23.html">looked like ice cube</a>.. ice cube isn't very happy.<br></p>

<br>


<p><a href="http://www.furnituresociety.org/cs/jul2003/newyork.html">here is some interesting furniture</a>.. angela jolie should probably <a href="http://www.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,30500-12382150,00.html">get some</a>.. furniture..<br>
<a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/munitions/tow.htm">these</a> are the missiles which supposedly killed the Hussein sons.<br>
Scientists are saying that we should all <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/health/story.jsp?story=426768">become vegan</a>... so <a href="http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/world/2007360">sad</a>...<br></p>

<br>


<p>anyway..</p>

I love how the U.S. treated North Korea completely different than Iraq. North Korea was telling everyone who would listen that they have nuclear weapons.. the U.S. basically told North Korea to shut up.. whereas when Iraq said they didn't have WMD, the U.S. attacked, wtf...<br></p>

                <p>Last night I came home early and worked a bit. I was so tired though. I didn't get much done. today however is a different story.. after getting off rather slowly I finally got on track and worked a bunch. I got a lot of the first part of my project done. it is still far from being completed - but.. it is right on track.. eek.. still it is a big project.<br></p>

<br>


<p>my headphones have been a total lifesaver. I was able to work outside without being as distracted. it is really fun. I can't even hear my phone ring. or the firetrucks that go by. nothing.. but music. so nice. the best part is that you don't have to crank the volume to have a good experience. I can have it softer and still feel like I am able to really hear the music. it is quite nice. I always used to laugh at the reviews where people claimed to hear more from recordings.. like "once I tried the shure e2c headphones I was able to hear parts of the recordings I hadn't noticed before." heh. but it is true. I noticed a lot of new stuff in cds I have had for years and almost worn out. I mean.. the quite things.. like the studio artifacts and little drum taps.. and all sorts of good stuff.. skinny puppy rules. but yea. I would say that the shur e2c headphones are my new favorite toy. my ipod is happy too. it gets used so much more. it will be interesting to see how the commute goes tomorrow.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i think I am gunna start smoking.. hahah.. just kidding.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i need to go make some food. and then finish this shit.. ahaha. maybe I will get it all done. that would be amazing. I doubt it will happen though. but yea never know. I am thinking of making spaghetti. my laptop battery is low. I will have to stop working. woe is me. I guess I coudl go into my hot/stuffy room.<br></p>

<br>


<p>stupid girls. why dont they come and find me.. they always leave me alone.. I guess maybe the "i will wait for the girls to come to me" philosophy of matiss' may not be good for me. it seems so nice though. no maintenence. someday.. SOME DAY..... aahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh</p>

                <p>so .. the last 2 weeks I haven't really hung out or gone out as much as I had before. it is weird when you go out an insane amount and then suddenly stop. I like it.. the stopping.. it was so relaxing and so nice. I hung out with my mom and aunt/cousin.. and hung out with marcia a bunch.. and now I am needing to re-introduce myself into the "real" world. I really love going out.. but it requires so much maintenence. you have to keep up with so much. I think I am going to edit what I do. because I need to balance my worlds a bit more. now that I have three worlds.. I have my going out world... my work world.. my good friend world.. and my ner world... wait that is four worlds.. I was doing well with two or three.. but four.. wow.. too much.. heh. I imagine I will work it out.<br></p>

<br>


<p>hanging out with marcia rules. hehe. totally. I am smitten. hopefully things work out reasonably well in that situation. it is always tough hanging out with new people.. you can't always predict how things will work or what the dynamics are in certain situations. I will probably soon know. girls with short short hair are cute.<br></p>

<br>


<p>Bec is leaving on monday. it is a real bummer. I am sure matiss is bummed. it sucks when people leave.. stupid people. hopefully we will hang out this weekend and have a really good time.<br></p>

<br>


<p>in other news.. my stress has led me to make drastic decisions in regards to my appearance. I now look like a frog. no really. I set up an appointment to finish up <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures/harper/tattoo">my tattoo</a>.. which is super exciting. I am going to <a href="http://tomatotattoo.com">tomato tattoo</a> on thrusday. hopefully it rules. I am ALWAYS scared of tattoos.. cuz they really hurt. I will bring a camera. I want to get good pictures. I love pictures. then.. a week from thursday - I am going to the hair place to dye my hair again. this time a bit more drastic. I love it. I have had a <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fharper%2Fme&amp;img=haircut%20023.jpg">mohawk for so long now</a>.<br></p>

<br>


<p>soon I will be a real boy. with a little hope and a lot of love.. I will get my yoyo's today. <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fharper%2Fme&amp;img=Chicago%20016.jpg">i NEED them</a>. NEEEEED!</p>

                <p>The indy 500 rules. it is so totally insane. Last night we rolled in about 10 oclock and arrived amidst a bout of drunken insanity. This man called lurch was doing insane things. not normal things. it was crazy. so we drank a bunch and eventually made it to bed. My brother has a dv cam so we just filled a bunch of crazy stuff. They brought two scooters, and a golf cart. It is very fun. So today I woke up and started playing this crazy game on the golf cart.. I was wearing a leather coat and a helmet and we would go as fast as we could and attack our other campers while they threw anything they could find at us. then I would jump off and let the momentum carry me to attack. it ruled.<br></p>

<br>


<p>then we went and drove around the scooters. heh. It was all fun and games until I fell over and hit my face on the ground. heh. I now have a cut up lip, a black eye and a bruised nose. I look like I got in a bad ass fight. check out the <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Findy_500_03">pictures</a>. manny more to come. ;)</p>

                <p>So friday night was the <a href="http://www.fischerspooner">fischerspooner</a> show. it was really quite something. I enjoyed the calculated mistakes and insanity that made up the show. The guys seemed really great as well. Very funny. I loved the break away clothing. and all my friend were their. <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures/parties/fischerspooner_afterparty">Here are pictures</a> from the "afterparty." never mind my crotch.. it wasn't my fault..<br></p>

<p>Right now I am sitting outside in the sun.. working on my new server.. using my landlords wireless network.. which is strangly extending my wireless network about 100 feet. it rules so much. the neighbor kids are playing baseball.. with a beach ball.. I know I am going to have to fetch the ball sooner or later.. once it breaches the fence.. ;)<br>
It looks like one of them just took the ball to the face.. poor little girl.. she is sad.. hehe.. but wait.. amazingly she is back in the game..</p>

Among the photos were those of Jenna and Barbara Bush, the president?s twin 21-year-old daughters, Ballanco said, adding that soldiers took them down "to protect the president."</i></small></blockquote>

<p>I love the our leaders ability to really fudge certain things.. like the propaganda that they are spewing. it would be better if the propaganda didn't fall apart within fifteen minutes of them presenting it. good propaganda and spin needs to last for the duration of the conflict. how are the america people let alone the U.N. and NATO going to believe all this BS about Iraq and terrorism if the stories don't break down into not so complex <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/sections/wnt/US/terror030213_falsealarm.html">lies</a>.

                <p>I am mad at boston. mostly cuz it doesn't make a damn bit of sense. the roads all go this way and that. I was not aware of how drasticly logic chicago's roadway system was until about 45 minutes ago. also wtf is with the trains that make NO sense. serious. No sense at all. and they are really buses.. acting like trains. not trains at all. slackers...<br></p>

<br>


<p>bush is kinda dumb<br>
i have no doubt that this "state of the union" nonesense will only get us into trouble. I mean. what if I were to say. hey john - I am going to hit you in the face. and then hit john. and then a year later said. hey john, I am going to hit you in the face. would john just sit there. of course not. and then would I get mad when john grabbed a baseball bat and wielded it. wtf. yep. I would. I would get really pissed and I would point my gun at him and say. drop your bat. rather than say. hey. I won't hit you. this is a dumb analogy. it is going no where fast. whoops there it went<br></p>

<br>


<p>kinnera is mad cuz I don't mention her as much as I used to. well punk.. move to chicago. that is what I say.. sucka..<br></p>

<br>


<p>Miriam leaves in a couple days. it is sad. I need to go visit. and I just found out that my friend sebastion may live in cologne which is where miriam lives. I have got to get me a vacation to germany. yea.. and one to paris. and one to hong kong. and especially one to that condo I am gunna buy. oh and one to the get your loans paid off office. yea that one.<br></p>

<br>


<p>i love h&amp;m. chicago will soon get one. and everyone will start to dress the same. I like how it is like the target of cool clothes. it is like diesel target. hehe. wierd.<br>
that could kill the elitism of a lot of kids.. whoops..<br>
soon mondo will be here. I really like juggling festivals. they are fun and exciting. I am going to use a multiple hundred thousand dollar search engine to catalog and search my MP3s later tonight. it should be VERY interesting. I want to do it as a demo. I am excited. wheee. I do have a lot of death metal too.. I love my IPOD. it is my friend. and yours too..<br>
my phone is broked. wtf.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/cnet/stories/980889.htm">Wierd</a> - there is apparently a small amount of opposition to the government having a "super database" of information against us citizens. <a href="http://www.washtimes.com/national/20030116-72466627.htm">And in a shocking move</a> the US decides that N.

                <p>Last night a friend of mine gave me a couple tickets to the interpol show at the metro. it was a good time. I hadn't really heard them and they did put on a good show. it was nice to see and I was able to see soem friends and all that.. wee.. I should get my ipod today. I am excited. I am redoing my MP3 attitude.. I am gunna be setting up a centralized MP3 system for our apartment. I am kinda excited about the prospects.. heh. whatever.<br></p>

<br>


<p>on friday we all hung out and watched movies.. ate pizza and just chilled. it was funny - because I forget how much of a nerd I am - and my friend brock brought a friend over and I don't think she was into the "weird" movies that matiss and I were representin' - I laughed. I wonder what happens when people start hanging out with us. do they think we are insane. cuz are collection of entertainment is very "interesting.." in light of that.. my illuminati game should be arriving soon ;)<br></p>

<br>


<p>i am reading a book by Neil Gaimen called America Gods. I don't like it as much as I liked neverwhere, which is making me sad. hopefully good omens will be better. I enjoy my new style of reading: cluster reading. it is where I read a bunch of books by the same author all in a row. it is quite interesting.<br></p>

Here is a nifty <a href="http://www.beautyreborn.com/pages/beforeandafter.htm">link</a> - which garned the following quote from my friend john: "<i>I've never seen that many tits presented in such a...unerotic way.</i>" Oh and I almost forgot the most important link. <a href="http://www.skepticsannotatedbible.com/">here</a> is an annotated bible targeted towards skeptics. wheee..</p>

                <p>So last night my brother graduated college. It was probably the most entertaining graduation ceremony I have seen in a long long time. One of the speakers kept swearing and cussing.. hehe. and everyone kept gasping at what he was saying. but he kept it up - it was so funny. I laughed a bunch. Only 20 or so people graduated. so it was a very small group. After the ceremony we went to dinner at this nice sea food resturant. My first friend pam came and sat with us.. I say my first friend - cuz she was one of my first friends I met in chicago.. so it was nice to see her. THe funniest thing she told me was that she went on a couple of dates with C.C. deville. haha.. rule.<br></p>

<br>


<p>So then today.. we hung out and played at this weird tourist place. my brother and I played a couple mean games of air hockey and then we went on this boat accross the bay. It was nice. I like the ocean a lot. I would like to eventually live somewhere near the ocean. Oh yea.. last night at dinner I met my brothers friend <a href="http://www.kronusfilms.com">scott</a> - he is pretty cool ;)<br></p>

<br>


<p>It is interesting cuz I miss chicago a little. I miss work a little and I miss my friends a little. Usually I don't do these things. but work is going well and right now the who "friend" situation is nice. I really miss them.. heh. check the following links out: <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/134599925_webmurray20.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/voiceofthemirror/">here</a></p>

                <p>This is from a couple days ago but whatever:<br>
A report was released by a bunch of British physicians that said that <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993043">"A war against Iraq could kill half a million people, warns a new report by medical experts - and most would be civilians."</a>. Looks like we don't need to worry about anything. Oh yea - <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1023-966311.html">A secretive federal court on Monday granted police broad authority to monitor Internet use, record keystrokes and employ other surveillance methods against terror and espionage suspects.</a> - I guess I better watch it. ;) especially now that the chinese have <a href="http://www.washtimes.com/national/20021120-2387.htm">missiles that can reach places of interest.</a> But if we don't get nuked - we can always hope for democrats to come back and the <a href="http://slate.msn.com/default.aspx?id=2071929">stock market</a> to come back and play. In a weird twist.. the <a href="http://www.newsday.com/news/opinion/ny-vpcoc143002251nov14,0,7803300.column?coll=ny%2Dviewpoints%2Dheadlines">White House</a> is waging a secretive war on condoms. Totally makes sense. Maybe they are preparing to woe some of our more conservative allies for <a href="http://channels.netscape.com/ns/news/story.jsp?floc=FF-PLS-PLS&amp;id=11201131000283576&amp;dt=20021120113100&amp;w=RTR&amp;coview=">help</a> with a really poor war plan.<br></p>

<br>


<p>Oh. I am attempting seed <a href="http://www.googlism.com">googlism</a> to have something for my name and nata2. Here I go:</p>

<blockquote><small>nata2 is in the house.<br>
nata2 is god overall<br>
nata2 is heavenly ;)<br>
harper reed is the ruler of all<br>
harper reed is an angry angry old man - uhh<br></small></blockquote>


<p>anyway..</p>

                <p>Apparently a <a href="http://www.azone.org/notabd/">protest</a> is going down against the <a href="http://www.tabd.org/">Transatlantic Business Dialogue (TABD)</a>. The TABD offers an effective framework for enhanced cooperation between the transatlantic business community and the governments of the European Union (EU) and United States (US). Or the <a href="http://www.azone.org/notabd/index.php?content=history">TABD</a> is a coalition of U.S. and European CEOs, that is mandated by and gets unlimited access to the U.S. and European governments. It helps boost transatlantic trade for large corporations by promoting the WTO and knocking down "barriers to trade". According to the TABD barriers to trade can be, labor protections, food safety and health laws, and anything that blocks corporations' paths to unlimited profit.<br></p>

<br>


<p>I am guessing it is the latter. Anyway there is a protest party on thursday(7th of NOvember) against the TABD:</p>

<blockquote><small><b>wntr81 (9:55:09 AM)</b>: the TABD guys are staying at the Shereton(sp) Hotel<br>
<b>wntr81 (9:59:36 AM)</b>: thursday @ 4:30<br>
<b>wntr81 (9:59:49 AM)</b>: Boeing hq<br>
<b>wntr81 (10:00:02 AM)</b>: canal and washington<br>
<b>wntr81 (10:00:10 AM)</b>: and the hotel I guess<br></small></blockquote>


<p>Hopefully this will be a peaceful protest, however chicago has a great history of peace behind it. Especially the daley's. RULE. here are some links to pictures from previous TABD protests:<br>
A <a href="http://www.citybeat.com/tabd/images/new_images/tabd_gun_jb.jpg">police officer holding a gun</a><br>
<a href="http://www.citybeat.com/tabd/images/new_images/tabd_cop_run_mb.jpg">Police on the move</a><br>
and the best and scariest picture - <a href="http://www.citybeat.com/tabd/images/new_images/tabd_gunpoint_mb.jpg">a person at gunpoint</a><br></p>

<br>


<p><a href="http://www.azone.org/notabd/images/titanictabd.pdf">Here</a> is a flyer for the event. This is a really great write up on why <a href="http://www.citybeat.com/tabd/12second.html">police are violent at protests</a>. Of course, the police won't be violent. There is no reason for them to be so.<br></p>

<blockquote><small><a href="http://www.suntimes.com/output/news/cst-nws-prot05.html">Police Supt. Terry Hillard stressed Monday that the city welcomes peaceful protesters but will not tolerate thuggery. Officers have been training for months in riot control and flew to Washington to help police control crowds there in September. About 130 officers who are 6 feet 4 inches tall and taller have been selected to arrest violent demonstrators.</a></small></blockquote>

<p>Well. So here are the oglibitory links to misc. news around the world. Apparently the U.S. government has been engaging in a <a href="http://www.latimes.com/la-op-arkin27oct27001451,0,7355676.story">Secret war</a> against terrorism. Targeting the "Axis of Evil." This rules. I mean. what better to start a world conflict then secret wars. I love secret wars. Especially when it is fought by Donald Rumsfeld's <a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2002/11/01/120.html">secret police</a>. I trust them to do a good job. In a completely different world, Tom Petty <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/news/newsarticle.asp?nid=16913&amp;cf=399">rules</a>, especially concerning the music industry. There is some very interesting news and facts about the <a href="http://www.guerrillanews.com/cgi-bin/wwwthreads/showflat.pl?Cat=&amp;Board=conspiracy&amp;Number=83655&amp;page=0&amp;view=collapsed&amp;sb=5&amp;o=0&amp;part=">sniper</a> Weird.<br></p>

<br>


<p>Last night I went and saw Omar Saunders speak of the Roscetti Four. Apparently he was wrongfully convicted as an 18 year old of murdering and raping a yound medical student in chicago. He was convicted along with four other youth. They were found <a href="http://home.iprimus.com.au/dna_info/dna/JA_DNA_illnews_20011212a.html">innocent</a> and a bunch of people will most likely get in trouble for framing them.</p>


<p>WHat really frustrates me about this situation is how people when they here about it, or when activists talk about it - they mention how the tax payers are paying for these people to stay in jail and paying for the settlements. well right, but that is our job as tax payers. if we support bad politicians we will be held somewhat accountable for their horrible actions. THe thing that is frustrating for me is that no one is focusing on the fact that the <a href="http://www.beloitdailynews.com/202/2ill9.htm">people who commited</a> would have gotten away with it if it wasn't for these young men standing strong and figthing a really terrible system.</p>

                <p>I have always thought that a military action in Iraq without the support of the UN could result in igniting a much larger and more violent conflict. The fact that the middle east is a powder keg waiting to explode and the fact that numerous other geopolitical situations are walking a very thin line leads me to conclude now is not the time for an international conflict - especially one where the only support we have is from Great Britian. Seriously.. wtf good is Great Britian, they couldn't win a war if it was.. well I really don't know. but I know they are dumb. haha. So anyway, I started this post to alert yall of <a href="http://drudgereport.com/flashww.htm">this article</a>. Apparently Walter Cronkite agrees with me. Which is scary when you take in to consideration all of the years he has spent covering foriegn policy, and world news. He probably has a pretty good feel for the world climate. We may be in trouble.<br>
in other happier news, <a href="http://www.boston.com/dailynews/302/world/Japan_North_Korea_diplomatic_t%3A.shtml">japan and N. Korea's</a> diplomatic talks stall because of all the craziness that is going down with N.

<p>I have been a bad friend lately.. I keep missing things I want to participate in. Like a friend B-day party exactly one week ago. I wanted to go, but for soem reason it didn't work out. and then I was sad. wtf. I should have just gone. but whatever.. or I forget to call people. and then I remember way too late.. I am a luser. heh.<br></p>

<br>


<p>Speaking of luser.. here is something interesting:<br>

                <p>I juggled at six flags again this weekend. My hands turn so so black it is unnatural. they just change to a different shade altogether.. no matter how much you wash them. so troublesome. Anyway.. yesterday I worked a bunch and played with my mind not understanding time changes.. so funny. I am still pretty bummed about wellstone.

<br>


<p>Those are weird eh.<br>
Some weird things are going on in our world. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/russia/article/0,2763,820935,00.html">Russia</a> apparently decided not to wait for the "terrorists" to settle things and went ahead and gassed the church where 600 hostages were. The gas apparently killed around 150 of the hostages and has hopitalized 400 more. but fear not, the families of the dead will receive around $6000 for the trouble of losing a loved one. Oh and the U.S. is <a href="http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/bw-wh/2002/oct/28/102802615.html">not saying a thing</a>.<br>
I guess that more <a href="http://www.montserratreporter.org/pics/Hilary%20Clinton%20Senator.jpg">mainstream politicians</a> are starting to see the <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/micro_stories.pl?ACCT=617800&amp;TICK=NEWS&amp;STORY=/www/story/10-27-2002/0001828664&amp;EDATE=Oct+27,+2002">light</a>... However are they going to be helpful.. or are they just going to be annoying and use it to their own advantage?<br>
Gore Vidal is really mad. He is trying to start an investigation into <a href="http://www.observer.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,819931,00.html">whether the bush administration deliberatly ignored warnings</a> on 9/11. Now that would be insane.<br>
here is a joke for yall, however it isn't funny:<br></p>

<blockquote><small>President Bush and Colin Powell are sitting in a bar. A guy walks in and asks the bartender, "Isn't that Bush and Powell sitting over there?"<br>
The barman says, "Yep, that's them."<br>
So the guy walks over and says, "Wow, this is a real honor. What are you guys doing in here?"<br>
Bush says, "We're planning WW III ".<br>
And the guy says, "Really? What's going to happen?"<br>
Bush says, "Well, we're going to kill 140 million Arabs this time and one blonde with big tits.<br>
The guy exclaimed, "A blonde with big tits? Why kill a blonde with big tits?<br>
Bush turns to Powell, punches Powell on the shoulder, and says, "See, smart ass?! I told you no one would worry about the 140 million Arabs.</small></blockquote>


<p>See.. this is the problem...<br>
i manically misspell weird.</p>

                <p>I am listening the refused. I enjoy them quite a bit. I have a new project going. Well I have a couple. I have mentioned both of them on here before. The first is <a href="http://riottech.net">riottech</a>, my little concert listing. I rule. hehe. the second is the <a href="http://a500hacking.com%3C/a%3E/%3Ca%20href=">3gscreensaver.com</a>. The phone sites are a lot more interesting.. but riottech is more fun. The phone site is a great experiement in <a href="http://www.3gscreensaver.com/community.php">community</a> digital rigths management. I am trying to create a site that allows the community to decide what is appropriate or not. the key in this situation is to not get sued <b>;)</b> - it isn't working that well <b>:(</b> - alas I will concede with all demands.. and I am attempting to attain BMI, ASCAP, etc etc. it is maddening.<br></p>

<br>


<p>HEy I put up a links section that are different websites of some of my friends and interesting people I have found on the internet.. check it now <b>!!!!</b></p>

                <p>Last night I went to funk night at danny's.. however I forgot that I really don't like funk. heh. suxor.<br>
It was still really fun to hang out with friends and see and talk to ladawn., but I wish that I was listening or dancing to hip-hop. I guess I gotta find a hip-hop night so I can invite my friends over to that. heh. I guess I could have it at my house ;).<br></p>

<br>


<p>so here is a joke that took me forever to get:</p>

<blockquote><small><b>Q:</b>&amp;nbsp;How do you get an Elephant into a SafeWay Shopping Bag?<br>
<b>A:</b>&amp;nbsp;Take the f out of Safe and the F out of way.</small></blockquote>


<p>So yea.. totally didn't get it for like 2 hours. heh. had to explain it to my joke understanding friends.. ;) too bad ey. It is a good one..<br>
tonight. . I am supposed to goto a play by denis johnson, the author of jesus' son. It should be good..</p>

                <p>So anyway. this weekend was incredibly hot. like not fun hot. I was not excited. I can't quite remember what exactly went down this weekend. but I think we mostly hung out. My friend brock and amanda hung out on thursday.. friday I hung out with my friend sevren and some of his friends. they are so "classy." hehe. but the real gem(hehe) was on saturday. Some new friends of ours came over about one.. we went downtown and hung out and I street performed with matiss. We got there late.. which sucked for matiss. he had arrived downtown around seven.. an had to juggle without a break until like 1:30 or 2:30. that was rough for him I think. anyway. after we juggled.. we went to whole foods and got a whole bunch of food and cooked it in a big group effort. it ruled.We played slot cars(of course) and the letter game. and all sorts of other things. we then went to a birthday party and eventually to sleep. Then came the evil of sunday. however.. we killed the heat with bad movies.. reading.. and board games.. ugh.. so so hot.<br></p>

<ul>
<li>I guess that we get a police state for our summer present. I am <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20020722-6619304.htm">excited</a>. It seems that quite a few politicians want to give the military policing power. I think that this woudl be a bad idea.</li>
<li>Gore apparently for some silly reason claims that "<a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;cid=664&amp;u=/ap/20020721/ap_to_po/gore_3&amp;printer=1">Bush lied about the nation's economy.</a>" Gore is probably sore about losing or something.</li>
<li>It seems that the number of sexually active teenagers has <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20020722-76660856.htm">dropped</a>. Wierd.</li>
<li>The Rainbow/PUSH Coalition Conference 2002 has officially made a call to initiate a <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/output/news/cst-nws-push21.html">probe</a> into the corporate accounting scandals of the GOP. It seems that "President Bush's trading in corporate stock and Vice President Dick Cheney's tenure as chief executive of Halliburton Co., as well as activities by other high-ranking administration figures, were questionable enough to merit a Ken Starr-type federal investigation."</li>
<li>I love when reality becomes similar to the beginning of a horror movie. the pentagon is attempting to create <a href="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,322588,00.html">nonlethal weapons</a> that hurt but don't kill. This is where a strange and undocumented side effect creates zombies.. or turns people into mindless killers. hehe. we can only hope ey. yea. wierd.</li>
<li>a friend of mine wrote <a href="http://www.stoneeye.com/eyetalknow/oped/07-20-02.html">this</a> commentary about the auto industry. It is an interesting read.</li>
</ul>


<p>Well I supposed that is all. Soon I goto california. and I get to visit my brother. it shoudl be a good time. I am excited. I want to go on dates with girls someday. heh. I may be dreaming again. huh. haha.</p>

                <p>i love the internet. Awhile back I posted <a href="http://111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111.com">60X1.com</a>, I finally took the time to finish it and much to my chagrin it led me to some amazing sites:<br></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.tinkin.com/">tinkin</a> - this is the guy who made 60X1.com he has a bunch of really great anti war stuff. it is so good. it makes me happy I want to give this site to everyone as a gift. I think that politics is often forgotten when it comes to internet art. it is refreshing. but it reminds me that <a href="http://www.tinkin.com/peacefront.html">we are all sinners</a> <a href="http://www.tinkin.com/taliban.html">in</a> this <b>terrorist v terrorist</b> fight.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.hoogerbrugge.com/">hoogerbrugge</a> seems to be an incredible designer. I am a big fan of <a href="http://www.thethirdplace.com/">this</a> style. It is like other <a href="http://www.requiemforadream.com">sites</a>. I don't know if that guy is in hitek or whatever they are called. but he is incredible. especially his <a href="http://www.hoogerbrugge.com/ml.html">Modern Living</a> set.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.surfstation.lu/">Surfstation</a> - I haven't had a lot of time to check this out. but it seems to be what I need.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.alternet.org/">Alternet</a> - this is an alternative new source. it seems to fit rather well with what I feel. Check out <a href="http://www.alternet.org/story.html?StoryID=13554">this</a> article called "Bush Threatens Future of Peacekeeping."</li>
<li><a herf="http://www.23dpi.com">23dpi</a> is more along the lines of the sites I do. But it is done with style. hah. whereas the sites I do are done with a crayon. Well. I am out of here.. here being work.. work being ok. java being dumb. metallica being humorous. do you think the internet will become like shadowrun. I hope so.</li>

                <p>So Microsoft wants to control the national ID initiative with its .NET passport system. They want to issue every citizen a passport and then use the insecure protocol to run the national ID system.

I was walking along the street this weeked and a bike messanger throw what amounted to a handfull of flyers in our direction. they said: "<b>G.W. Bush wants war</b>." Which seems to be not very far from the truth.<br></p>

<br>


<p>In the past couple days I have noticed quite the mess of our foriegn policy. Maybe it was seeing president bush upclose and personal.. or maybe it was seeing the article that said that warrented nuke use would be in a confliect with china over taiwan and foreign policy. and then I see some articles showing how the U.S. is pissing china off beacuse we are not treating taiwan as a part of china, but as its own entity. The world is suddenly in a very unstable place.<br></p>

<br>

This is not good. Very much a bad situation.</p>


<p>Look at what we have so far:<br>
<br></p>


<ul>
<li>"We (members of the german army) have been put on alert, people are being revoked from holiday, all system/material checked, no talk policy. " (sid=21542&amp;cid=2277927)</li>
<li>"The US military is on alert. For security reasons I can't post more details, but the 82nd airborne division has been told to suit up and according to one report one unit is already in the air, though they're not sure where they'll be landing yet. Speculation is that they'll land at a known friendly base in the middle east and then decide where to go from there. " (sid=21542&amp;cid=2277977)</li>
<li>"I email I guy in the navy and he says he?s going out to the Atlantic right now" (friend of mine)</li>
<li>"think about what our lives will be like after this...i wonder how much more freedom will be taken away from us, in order to 'make america safe again'" (another friend)</li>
</ul>


<p>I feel scared like a little kid when I think of what a knee jerk reaction to this could cause. If this level of organization is available ? they must be ready for a reaction. And what could that be?</p>


<p>I hope that Bush is good at being a president for the first time when he reacts to this. I imagine his flight from Florida to ?Washington DC? is really the governments chance to remove him from the scene. This is important. With the president removed, the military going to the mideast, all western European countries are mobilizing their militaries ? ready them for attack. We do not need war. We need to be accountable for our actions ? just like we ask the ?attackers? to be.</p>


<p>It is important to not jump to conclusions, I heard many a person whom I thought was open minded and not a hatemonger say racist things about Palestinians and Arabic people ALREADY. This is not acceptable. We need to be careful and not attack a people for the mistakes and attacks of someone of there ethnicity.</p>
