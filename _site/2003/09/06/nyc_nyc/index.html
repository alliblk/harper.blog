<strong>Hi.</strong> I am an engineer who builds paradigm-shifting tech and leads others to do the same. I love using the enormity of the Internet to bring people together, whether as CTO of Obama for America, CTO at Threadless.com, or on my own projects. You can often find me playing with new technology, looking for something to hack, or enjoying life in Chicago with my amazing wife, Hiromi. Check out my <a href="http://harperreed.com">homepage</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=harper" target="_blank">follow me on twitter</a>.

    <p>So yesterday was nuts. I got up made sure I was packed for nyc and went to work. at work - I was whisked away on a cruise around lake michigan for employee appreciation day. We got free food - expensive drinks and generally had a nice time. I got to meet some of the new young people. I think we are going to start a young person club. it will be pretty dope I think... then at 2:00 or so we left.. I walked to the blue line.. went home.. grabbed my stuff.. taunted my brother over the phone.. went to o'hare and flew to pittsburgh. I hate flying non direct. I always forget.. but whatever. <br/><br/>then I got into nyc at around 11. I went to tommie and marks place and putzed around with them for about an hour and then we went to this club called passerby. whew. it is insanity. it had a light up floor. and drinks. it is also full of craziness. seriously. mark got beat up by amjad and chris.. weird.. heh.. and everyone was nuts. I got into a bed around 7ish. hehe. it was a long day. I had been up for 24 hours.. well not really - if you don't count the time difference it will have been 24 hours.. whatever. <br/><br/>tonight.. umm.. apparently there is a party for xlr8r and lizzie?? from fischerspooner is having a virgo-fest.. both of which should be interesting.. oh yea. interesting. but yea<br/><br/>nyc is rather dope. I wonder if it will be my next step. nobody knows. I like chicago. but chicago pales in comparison to nyc. but I like my job and don't really want to leave the comfortable roomates and all that. besides it is kinda expensive. actually I think the housing is really expensive. sad day. maybe I can convince hiromi and matiss to move her.. adn then convince worldbook to also move here. hahaha.. nobody knows..</p>
