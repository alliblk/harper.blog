<strong>Hi.</strong> I am an engineer who builds paradigm-shifting tech and leads others to do the same. I love using the enormity of the Internet to bring people together, whether as CTO of Obama for America, CTO at Threadless.com, or on my own projects. You can often find me playing with new technology, looking for something to hack, or enjoying life in Chicago with my amazing wife, Hiromi. Check out my <a href="http://harperreed.com">homepage</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=harper" target="_blank">follow me on twitter</a>.

    <p>I have needed to update this site for so long. I guess really since last thursday. So last thursday I went out with some friends.. maybe a little too late.. it was all my poor little body could handle. I was horribly sick the next day and had to stay home from work.. which sucks.. cuz work is cool right now.. but whatever. so I slept most of the day - but was supposed to drive to Champaign/urbana for a juggling fest around 11 at night. I ended up doing that.. however I lost ALL of my mp3s off my ipod right before I left. I was able to get msot of it back .. but the cds I wanted to listen to I had left at work. so I was really pissed. HOW annoying. so we left for champaign adn arrived and slept at our friends house. we went to juggling the next day. it was fun. I hung out with some really cool cats and learned how to do a top. that night we all went to a nice mexican resturant and one of the cool jugglers paid for our dinner. he is great. it was like 13 people or something insane. Then we went to a juggler party in an insane house with thousands(well 10 or so) arcade games. it was like having a party at an arcade. it was quite funny. matiss and I hung out with mark and jsut bullshitted.. hah. so fun.. then back to juggling.. adn then to chicago.. and then to the computer where I made a new site.. <br/><a href="http://war.watership.org/">war.watership.org</a><br/>This site is a link log of all the crazy news articles I read about the war. I also made a bunch of <a href="http://www.dopeman.org/ads/">ads</a> as well. I don't know about them. they are supposed to be in a magazine.. wheee<br/><br/>i am tired now. I need to go home and sleep.. actually clean.. my apartment is so messy and gross right now</p>
