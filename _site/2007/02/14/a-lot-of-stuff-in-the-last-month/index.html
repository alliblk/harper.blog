<strong>Hi.</strong> I am an engineer who builds paradigm-shifting tech and leads others to do the same. I love using the enormity of the Internet to bring people together, whether as CTO of Obama for America, CTO at Threadless.com, or on my own projects. You can often find me playing with new technology, looking for something to hack, or enjoying life in Chicago with my amazing wife, Hiromi. Check out my <a href="http://harperreed.com">homepage</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=harper" target="_blank">follow me on twitter</a>.

  <div class="postcontent">
    <p>I know I know. I have been a bad bad blogger. I basically I have been ignoring the fact that I have a blog. For a long time - - pretty much since I got back from japan at the beginning of January. eep. What weird is that I have been playing computer a lot - but mostly doing workish things. it made it hard to justify blogging when I had 100 things on my plate. whoops. But now things have settled down a bit.  I feel a more static, and I don't think that everything is going to blow up. Its nice to breathe!</p>

<p>This month has been manic change month. I got rid of at least half of my stuff, Hiromi moved back to Chicago, Hiromi and I got a new place, I moved, and we now have a nice apartment together. Its really nice. We moved from Logan square to Lincoln square (we are such squares) and we love the new neighborhood. It will be a lot nicer in the summer when don't have to be so cold and walk through this inclement weather. SOON.</p>

<p>Our apartment is only around 6 blocks from skinnyCorp - so my commute is much better than the 2 hours I was commuting with CTA buses. OMG. I am so happy about that change. The one thing that I am unhappy about - is now I have "less" forced time to read. I now have to make myself read at home - since I no longer have to sit on a bus for 2 hours a day. heh. War and Peace is going to take forever to get through. hah.</p>

<p>We are slowly getting our apartment back together. We don't have a lot of furniture - which is nice. Both Hiromi and I like it when it is minimal and nice. Our place is pretty cozy - but since its just the two of us it is just right. I can't wait for better weather so that we can hang out in the sun room. It will be my reading nook.</p>

<p>In regards to technology - I am dropping one of my colocated servers and getting a little more interesting hosting plan for hosting friends. Its on <a href="http://mosso.com">mosso</a> which is one of those fancy "clustered" hosting systems. But it is a rackspace company and not evil. So far it has been amazing. This time I plan to actually invoice people which will revolutionize my hosting abilities. It has been fun and crazy trying to move 100 domains and 25 clients in a week. hah. stupid hardness. But it will be worth it when I save around $400 a month in hosting fees.</p>

<p>So that is pretty much it. I am really happy Hiromi is here with me. We are happy.</p>

<p>happy valentines day. and <a href="http://dylanreed.org">happy birthday Dylan</a>!</p>
