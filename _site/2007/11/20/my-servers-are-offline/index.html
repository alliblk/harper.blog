<strong>Hi.</strong> I am an engineer who builds paradigm-shifting tech and leads others to do the same. I love using the enormity of the Internet to bring people together, whether as CTO of Obama for America, CTO at Threadless.com, or on my own projects. You can often find me playing with new technology, looking for something to hack, or enjoying life in Chicago with my amazing wife, Hiromi.

    <p>For the first time in almost 7 years my servers are offline.</p>

<p>I just shut them down. It was pretty sad. They were good servers. They did a  lot of traffic. They were slashdotted, dugg, reddited, and probably any other  sited that was hot shit in the last 6 years.Â  I installed them when my dedicated  host died in early 2001. Originally I just shipped them a box, which they hooked  up. The original box was a VA Linux box from their fire sale. It owned. I paid  200 a month for unlimited transfer. At that time I was doing about 25G a day in  transfer. heh. Then in 2003, I bought a bundle of hardware to upgrade my  infrastructure and added a firewall, a super fast switch and another server.  With all this fanciness I was able to pull an average of about 120G a day... for  3 years straight. Which I think is around 130 terabytes. I guess that is what i  get for hosting shady content. ;)</p>

<p>So now I embark on a new style of hosting. A mix of hardware, shared and  virtualized.Â  I have a box at <a href="http://leaseweb.com/">leaseweb</a>, a demo  box at <a href="http://mediatemple.net/">mediatemple </a>(it is pretty dope), a  bundle of stuff at <a href="http://mosso.com/">mosso</a> and then a handful of  sites sprinkled around ec2. It makes me sad to not have full control of my  sites. I am bummed that mosso doesn't offer SSH. I am worried that my hosting  cocktail will not handle my needs and that I will be hit with crazy overages. I  can't afford a 10k hosting bill. that would be annoying.</p>

<p>When i think how this hosting plan is how most people host stuff, I can't  imagine their pain. Through managing my own boxes, I learned SO much. I fought  hackers (both brazillian and korean). I fought lawsuits. I fought clients and  users. I learned how to manage load, how to scale php, how to work out kinks in  a cheap infrastructure and all the fun tricks that got me to my job at  threadless. But most of all I learned that I really love linux and open source  software.</p>

<p>I will miss you servers! Peaces!</p>
