<p>I am constantly telling my friends about the new technology tricks that I learn in my internet travels. I learn a lot, which has caused my friends to ignore around 90% of what I say about technology. I don't mind, because I know that I am a genius(heh) and they will come around some day.</p>

<p>This is exactly what happened with my most recent hacked upon hosting setup. I told my buddy <a href="http://twitter.com/ryankanno">kanno</a>, and he didn't pay attention. Then he started diving in a bit on his own. Once he experienced a taste of the magic, I helped him to the rest of the koolaid and he was hooked. The result was him begging me to do this post to help people understand how awesome this setup is.</p>

<h2>The problem</h2>

<p>I hate hosting. I hate (really love - but love to hate) servers. I <strong>reallllllllllllllllllly</strong> like not having to deal with scaling, servers, server software and all that magic.</p>

<p>Besides servers and dealing with the tech side of hosting, I really hate paying for hosting. I especially hate paying to host sites that will get no traffic and will not change.</p>

<p>Here are some examples of the sites I am talking about:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.fastmilo.com">fastmilo.com</a> - this site gets 21 visits a year.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.chicagocanoeclub.com">chicagocanoeclub.com</a> - this site gets 13 visits a year.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.weownthesun.com/">weownthesun.com</a> - this site gets 8 visits a year</li>
<li><a href="http://www.harpercloud.com/">harpercloud.com</a> - this site gets 5 visits a year</li>
<li><a href="http://www.nutpunt.com/">nutpunt.com</a> - this site gets 3 visits a year.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.stevereed.org/">stevereed.org</a> - this site gets 2 visits a year.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.noahleaks.com/">noahleaks.com</a> - this site gets 1 visits a year.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.biofuelmenace.com/">biofuelmenace.com</a> - this site gets 1 visits a year.</li>
</ul>


<p>Basically simple one or multiple page joke/history/ego sites. Easy to make, no maintenance and no dynamic content.</p>

<p>There were all hosted at Rackspace Cloud Sites for the longest time. I got tired of paying $100 bucks just to host stupid stuff. I thought about moving them all to one tiny linode/slice/ec2/rackspace cloud box - but that would have been more than $100/month of maintenance. It also wouldn't have solved the problem for me. I would still be paying to host these sites.</p>

<p>Just as I was about to give up and delete myself from the internet completely - in walks <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">App Engine</a> with its fancy pants friend, <a href="http://drydrop.binaryage.com">DryDrop</a>.</p>

<h2>DryDrop is an easy way to host static content on App Engine</h2>

<p><a href="http://drydrop.binaryage.com">DryDrop</a> is at its most basic form a bucket that holds the various pieces of a static site, and serves the pieces when they are requested. It is git backed for easy content management. It is mostly for nerds.</p>

<p>From the <a href="http://drydrop.binaryage.com">DryDrop site</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>DryDrop is a tool that lets you host your static site on Google App Engine and update it by pushing to GitHub. Thanks to GitHub post-receive hooks your App Engine site can be updated automatically when you push new content."</p></blockquote>

<p>From <a href="http://twitter.com/dansinker">@dansinker</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>it's a tool that you install on AppEngine that lets you publish web pages on Google's servers using nothing but github.
So like, I update the <a href="http://www.chicagomayoralscorecard.com/">Scorecard</a> simply by typing "git push" and suddenly, WHOOOOSH, the scorecard is updated.
I seriously love it more than is probably healthy.</p></blockquote>

<p>As their site points out, this means that you can host your static content with zero cost, zero maintenance and very little real tech knowledge (just <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software">git</a>), a bit of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rake_(software">rake</a>) and some gigantic internet nuts).</p>

<p>The DryDrop workflow <a href="http://drydrop.binaryage.com/#installation">is as follows</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Checkout the DryDrop repository from github</li>
<li>Deploy your drydrop app to app engine (<em>rake upload project=drydropsample</em>)</li>
<li>Create a git repository on github</li>
<li>Place static content in the github repository</li>
<li>Link the two (<em>add the github repo raw url in the drydrop admin settings</em>)</li>
<li>Visit app engine app url (<em>this pulls the static content from github and caches it</em>)</li>
<li><strong>BAM</strong> you have a site hosted on google's infrastructure.</li>
</ul>


<p>Super easy and convenient. The best part is that this is free if your static site doesn't use more resources than the free tier of app engine allows.</p>

<p>I used this and my mind was blown. However, there were a couple of things missing.</p>

<h2>Hosting multiple domains on one instance</h2>

<p>After I played with drydrop extensively and launched a few sites, I noticed a hole in the drydrop armor. For every site you launched, you had to deploy a version of the drydrop container to app engine. Although they were all free, most people only have 10 application slots, and it was a pain to manage. I needed a way to host multiple sites on one instance.</p>

<p>I thought about this for about 2 seconds before I remembered solving this problem with some other python apps hosted on App Engine. I needed to key the datastore off of the domain (now-a-days you could use the <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/multitenancy/">multitenacy stuff</a> and just set the app namespace to change for each served domain (this might be a good idea to migrate drydrop too - i will do that later)).</p>

<p>I made the change on my fork and deployed it to GAE. Then did a bunch of tests to make sure it worked properly. It did and the code was pulled into the main drydrop repo. Excitement.</p>

<p>Now you can deploy one drydrop app and host many many domains off a single app instance. I currently host about 15 domains off of one drydrop instance.</p>

<h2>Free Hosting, FTW</h2>

<p>Let's review what we have:</p>

<p>Free hosting for multiple domains consisting of static content on a google scale infrastructure. For free.</p>

<p>This is awesome. and once you have it set up, there are only two steps to getting another site hosted (1. register domain, 2. point to drydrop instance). I launch stupid sites constantly now. It is an addiction. I need help.</p>

<h2>Pro-Tips</h2>

<p>I have used this setup for about 6 months. It works super well. I noticed that things loaded super fast all over the world, which is pretty awesome.</p>

<p>I have done 3 things to make things faster: use a CDN, use the high performance replication scheme, and use always on instances to decrease startup time.</p>

<p>I will attempt to cover each of these quickly.</p>

<h3>Use a CDN</h3>

<p>I use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/">Amazon Cloudfront</a> with a <a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2010/11/amazon-cloudfront-support-for-custom-origins.html">custom origin</a>. This is simply a way to take advantage of using a cdn without having to uplaod my data and assets to s3 first. I have <a href="https://gist.github.com/780318">two scripts that I use to manage this process</a>. The <a href="https://gist.github.com/780318#file_create_custom_origin.py">first sets up the origin server</a> with cloudfront, the <a href="https://gist.github.com/780318#file_invalidate_cf_cdn.py">second clears my cached items</a> when I need to deploy a change.</p>

<p>How this works is simple. I cname <a href="http://media.nata2.org/images/AStrangeYouCanBelieveIn.png">media.nata2.org</a> to cloudfront. Then every request to that domain goes to cloudfront. Cloudfront checks if the asset exists on itself, if it doesn't it goes and fetches it from the pre set origin server (in this case www.nata2.org) and then serves it. All subsequent requests are served directly off of the CDN. No more scripts to upload shit.</p>

<p>I think this is the only civilized way to use a CDN. I hope that Akamai/Rackspace rolls this out in the future. I prefer Akamai's network to Amazons.</p>

<h3>Use the High Performance Replication Datastore on App Engine</h3>

<p>Very recently Google released a neat addition to the App Engine world: <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/datastore/hr/overview.html">High Replication Datastore</a>. From the google app engine post:</p>

<blockquote><p>The High Replication Datastore provides the highest level of availability for your reads and writes, at the cost of increased latency for writes and changes in consistency guarantees in the API.
The High Replication Datastore increases the number of data centers that maintain replicas of your data by using the Paxos algorithm to synchronize that data across datacenters in real time.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>BOO YEA!</strong></p>

<p>This makes your simple static no write app engine app bullet proof (it seems). If there is a data store outage - this should keep your app up and running.</p>

<p>The downside is that it is about twice as expensive to host. There is a chance that it will still be free for a static site.</p>

<p>I have played with this less, but have deployed it to my blog and we shall see soon if it works well or costs me an arm and a leg.</p>

<h3>Set the app to be "Always On"</h3>

<p>Another recent feature added to App Engine is the ability to keep an <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/adminconsole/instances.html#Always_On">instance of your app "on"</a>. This should decrease startup times for stale apps.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when I visit one of these sites that don't get a lot of traffic there is a small pause while the app starts up. With an Always On instance, this should stop happening. App Engine keeps an instance of your application warm and ready to server for a measly $0.30 per day ($9.00 per month). A pretty sweet deal if your site suddenly not performing worries you.</p>

<p>I have only played around with this - and haven't deployed it to my blog or in production sites. I also don't notice a huge problem with sites not serving quickly enough.</p>

<h2>Awesome</h2>

<p>The last two tips are app wide - which means that they will work for all sites that are deployed on that instance of DryDrop. You will be able to split the costs associated with the high performance replication and the ALways On instances across the number of domains you are hosting.</p>

<p>This makes me LOVE hosting again.</p>

<p>2010 was a great year. I rarely write these retrospectives (only <a href="http://www.nata2.org/2009/01/04/2008-retrospectiv/">2008</a> I think), but i think about writing them every year. It is so cheesey, but also a fun exercise in memory and retrospection.</p>

<p>So.. here goes.</p>

<p>2010 was a great year. I spent a bunch of time helping startups, hanging out with friends, spending time with Hiromi, traveling and enjoying life.</p>

<h1>Work</h1>

<p>I spent most of 2010 doing my best to avoid deliverables and enjoy not having a day to day job.</p>

<p>I started out 2010 in San Antonio, TX hanging out with my friends at <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/">Rackspace</a>. Rackspace is an awesome company and is powered by a great group of people. They are doing some neat stuff and are fighting a good fight. I am excited to see some of the stuff we talked about come to fruition. The coolest of those things is <a href="http://www.openstack.org/">Open Stack</a> taking off. This changed everything in the cloud world. I finished my Rackspace gig in April. It was a great opportunity and hilarious to hang out in a <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/green/rackspace-offers-a-unique-green-way-to-recycle-an-abandoned-mall/768">mall</a>. I was also excited to have Rackspace <a href="https://www.cloudkick.com/acquisition-faq">acquire</a> my friends at <a href="https://www.cloudkick.com/">Cloudkick</a>. That was a great move. Congratulations to everyone involved.</p>

<p>After the Rackspace gig was over, I had nothing else planned. It allowed me to jump into my next plan. Learning about Startups, Venture Capital and the business of business. <strong>;)</strong></p>

<h1>Startups</h1>

<p>2010 also allowed me to further my interest in venture capital and startup funding.</p>

<p>I spent a lot of time with <a href="https://sandboxindustries.com/">Sandbox Industries</a>. They have a bunch of neat things going on and are succeeding in helping change the Chicago startup landscape. I am excited to see what 2011 brings fro <a href="http://bookyap.com/">Bookyap</a>, <a href="https://lab42.com/">Lab 42</a> and <a href="http://www.marblesthebrainstore.com/">Marbles: the Brain Store</a> and the other Sandbox startups.</p>

<p>I also had a chance to hang out with my friends at <a href="http://www.dfjmercury.com/">DFJ Mercury</a>. <a href="http://www.dfjmercury.com/blair-garrou/">Blair</a> and <a href="http://www.dfjmercury.com/aziz-ahmed-gilani/">Aziz</a> are awesome. I also am super excited about my friends and DFJ portfolio companies <a href="http://infochimps.com/">Infochimps</a> and <a href="http://graphic.ly/">Graphicly</a>. 2011 is going to be awesome for them. I can't wait to see this crew at SXSW 2011. It should be insane and fun.</p>

<p>Startup funding has changed quite a bit in 2010. I was lucky to be at the forefront of this change by being a Angel List scout. You can learn more about it on my <a href="http://www.nata2.org/2010/09/03/yes-i-am-a-venture-hacks-scout/">scout blog post</a>. Interacting with Naval and Nivi has been awesome. They are great dudes who are changing the face of startup funding whether the industry wants it or not.  It will be neat to see how 2011 turns out with early stage funding.</p>

<p>I cannot wait for Chicago to see the funding impact of Groupon's success. It is really exciting to see my friends achieve so much and I am very excited for how this impacts Chicago in the next 5 years. My buddy <a href="http://twitter.com/leonc">Leon Chism</a> wrote a <a href="http://leonc.tumblr.com/post/2071971732/chicago-mafias">post on this topic awhile ago, I suggest you read it</a>.</p>

<p>Speaking of startups in Chicago, 2010 was a record year for startup culture and execution for us Chicagoans. We saw the rise of Groupon, the <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/hn-chicago">Chicago hacker news meetups</a> and a few <a href="http://startupmixology.techcocktail.com/2010-chicago/">good conferences</a>. I am super exctied to see what this Chicago startup community achieves in 2011. Stay tuned.</p>

<h1>Technology</h1>

<p>In 2010 I launched a few neat applications. I soft launched <a href="http://www.ctaalerts.com/">CTA Alerts</a> with Dan X. O'Neil - a aggregation of various alerts in the Chicago Transit system (with the coolest URL shortener - <a href="http://trn.st">trn.st</a>).</p>

<p>I launched <a href="http://supertrackr.com">Supertracker</a> - a really neat "track everything" via xmpp site powered by my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/julien51">Julien's</a> startup <a href="http://superfeedr.com">Superfeedr.com</a>. SuperTrackr got a bunch of writeups and was doing crazy incoming <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/">PuSH</a> traffic. All scaled magically by App Engine.</p>

<p>I also launched the hilarious <a href="http://ProximityCheckin.com">ProximityCheckin.com</a> - a site that merges your Google Latitude location with foursquare checkins. Originally I wanted it to be automagic - but that is complicated. I am still experimenting with it and should have some progress shortly.</p>

<p>All of the above applications were weekend projects built on <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">App Engine</a>. I enjoy App Engine and can't wait to see what is next for that platform.</p>

<p>In 2010 I also got addicted to personal informatics. I got a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002JE2PSA?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=nata2productions&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002JE2PSA">withings scale</a> and a fitbit and started tracking all sorts of things manically. I <a href="http://harperreed.org/informatics">hooked it into my personal site</a> and made <a href="http://harperreed.org/informatics/steps/">some</a> <a href="http://harperreed.org/informatics/weight/">graphs</a>.</p>

<p>I also started tracking my location as well. You can see <a href="http://harperreed.org/where">up-to-date location infomation on my personal site as well</a>. Including a <a href="http://harperreed.org/where/now">relatively accurate real time display of my location</a>. I love Google latitude and am excited for all the things that can be powered by constantly updating location information.</p>

<p>I also scored a really neat award based on the work my buddy Dan X O'neil and I did on the CTA api. You can check out my <a href="http://www.nata2.org/2010/09/25/cta-hacking-unofficial-apis-and-winning-a-data-innovation-award/">write-up</a> to learn more. I love the civic hacking.</p>

<p>2011 is going to be an amazing year for technology. My simple "2 word" predictions are: Cheap Android, More Javascript, Kindle Epub, more Nodejs, auto scaling, app engine, and minor AI. I am excited.</p>

<h1>Personal</h1>

<p>In 2010 we moved from lincoln square to wicker park.</p>

<p>We hung out in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/sets/72157625598388247/">Japan</a> for a bunch of time and we spent  a bunch of time in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeley,_Colorado">Greeley, CO</a>. It was nice to spend some quality time with Hiromi's family and my family.</p>

<p>My <a href="http://dylanreed.com">brother</a> and I played <a href="http://minecraft.net/">Minecraft</a> a bunch. It was a bit like when we played legos as kids. However, I was better sharing the pieces with Minecraft. <a href="http://harperreed.org/minecraft/">Here is a map of our world</a> as of 01/01/2011.</p>

<p>One of the best parts of 2010 was hanging out with my amazing wife Hiromi. She is awesome!</p>

<p>It was a great year and was awesome. Things were low key and everything was wonderful.</p>

<li>I spent <strong>20 days</strong> (<strong>5.48% of the year</strong>) in Japan. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/sets/72157625598388247/">It was amazing</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h1>2011 is going to be awesome</h1>

<p>I am very excited for everything that 2011 is going to bring. I have a lot of plans. Stay tuned.</p>

<p>I meant to post this months ago. hah. For some reason, it didn't quite make it live. Then a couple days ago, I was talking to a friend about his recent move to Lincoln Square. We spent some time talking about great places to go eat and hang out, and I remembered this post. I thought I would get it up and out there.</p>

<p>A couple months ago, Hiromi and I moved from Lincoln Square to Wicker Park. We had wanted to live in Wicker Park for many years and since we have nothing keeping us in Lincoln Square - we decided to go ahead and move.</p>

<p>Lincoln Square was awesome.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed living there for the 3 years we were there. The neighborhood was awesome. The people were great. The nightlife was... well, there was a bunch of great restaurants. ;)</p>

<p>I wanted to take a minute to chronicle the places we went to a bunch and the places we liked. Hopefully this list will helpful to someone. These are all the places I will miss.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.jurysrestaurant.com/">Jury’s</a> - This place is insane. It has great hamburgers, great food and great service. It also has one of the strangest crowds in Lincoln Square. Always makes me chuckle.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.drewseatery.com/">Drew’s Eatery</a> - I like drew. He is nice. His eatery is a great place to get an afternoon snack or quick dinner. Very vegan friendly. This is key. They have Italian beef sandwiches. It isn’t often you can go to a vegan friendly place and order an Italian beef sandwich. I enjoy their water in a box.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.theglobepub.com/">The Globe</a> - I think i went here 500 times for lunch with the SkinnyTech crew. It is a good place to watch people, football, rugby or have cheese fries.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.cafe28.org/">Cafe28</a> - I love cafe 28. I suggest you go there immediately.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.adeliciousvegancafe.com/">Delicious Cafe</a> - another vegan friendly place in the area. They have great vegan sandwiches and sweets. They often host dinners and other special vegan events.
*<a href="http://maps.google.com/places/us/il/chicago/w-leland-ave/2308/-rosded-restaurant?gl=us">Rosded</a> - This is my favorite Thai place. It is cheap, good and small - as all thai places should be.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.costellosandwich.com/">Costellos</a> - makes good sandwiches. We often walked there on an afternoon. It is always packed with families.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.halfacrebeer.com/">Half Acre Brewery</a> - a recent addition to the neighborhood. It is a great way to grab a growler for a party or BYOB place.
*<a href="http://maps.google.com/places/us/il/chicago/w-montrose-ave/2030/-mythos-restaurant?hl=en&amp;gl=us">Mythos</a> - Mythos is insane. I love every bit of it. If you are a fan of Greek foods and like BYOB then this place is for you. Mix it with some wine or the aforementioned Half Acre growler.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.glennsdiner.com/">Glenn’s</a> - I think this is one of my favorite places in Lincoln Square. It is hilariously packed. Make a reservation.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.merzapothecary.com/">Mertz</a> - this is for hiromi and hippies. They have nice soap.</li>
<li><a href="http://store.hazelchicago.com/">Hazel</a> - A nice gift store/nick nack store. A great place for picking up gifts or party favors. I recommend it. We got many good items here. The people are always nice and they do gift wrapping.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.firstslice.org/">First Slice cafe</a> - another great lunch spot. Out of the way. tasty and nice.</li>
<li><a href="http://chosunokrestaurant.com/">Cho Sun Ok</a> - The insane people who went here took ALL of our parking spots, always. But for good reason. this is a great korean place.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.google.com/movies?hl=en&amp;near=Chicago&amp;dq=davis+theatre&amp;theater=davis">Davis Theatre</a> - It is like a grindhouse theatre mixed with yuppies. A great place to see a cheap movie.</li>
</ul>


<p>I imagine I missed a bunch of great places. If you have any favs, leave them in the comments.</p>

<p>I really like Lincoln Square. I think we would live there again.</p>

<p>On October 28th, I had the pleasure of speaking at the Tech Cocktail Startup Mixology Conference. It was a fun quick conference with a set of amazing speakers.</p>

<p>Below is my talk. I spoke about fostering a community of problem solvers. Here are my <a href="https://docs.google.com/present/view?id=dd3wvxq5_649fzcvqpvz&amp;interval=5&amp;autoStart=true">slides</a>.</p>

<p>Would love to know your thoughts.</p>

<p>I am excited to see Tech Cocktail grow. I have been going to TC for years now. Threadless sponsored the first TC in boulder, we had tables at various TC's in Chicago. Scott and I did a really amazing presentation on printers at the first TC conference. It has been awesome. I can't wait to see what Frank has in store for TC next.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/juggernautco/2913444222/in/photostream/"><img align="right" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3250/2913444222_5f01a20397_m.jpg"></a>Back in 2008 I hacked an <a href="http://www.nata2.org/2008/10/06/chicago-transit-api/">unofficial api</a> together from the exposed endpoints of the CTA’s bustracker application. This spawned a bunch of CTA applications in the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2009/04/iphone-app-showdown-battle-of-the-cta-bus-trackers.ars">iOS app store</a>, the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=chicago+transit+authority+android">android app store</a> and created a really neat <a href="http://www.transitchicago.com/apps/">ecosystem</a> of <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/transitapi">CTA hackers</a>.</p>

<p>For awhile, nobody but us transit nerds paid attention to this api/hack. However, as more and more apps were built and more and more people used those apps - more people started noticing the benefits from the opening of this “api.”</p>

<p>The API got a number of really good write-ups, particularly about how the API was unofficial and how I went around hacking it. The first (and best) was by my good friend Dan X. O’neil: <a href="http://www.derivativeworks.com/2009/01/h.html">"The power is not the mashup. It's the data."</a>. From here a bunch of really great posts popped up talking about the unofficial API and innovation. Joe Hughes blogged about whether the unofficial API is <a href="http://headwayblog.com/2008/12/14/unofficial-cta-apis/">innovation on borrowed time</a>. Programmable Web <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2009/01/27/hacking-chicagos-unofficial-transit-api/">summarized Dan’s piece and added some commentary</a>.</p>

<p>In the aforementioned post by Dan O'Neil, He talks about how we visited the CTA and chatted with them about the API. In the world of litigious organizations and scary governments - working with the CTA was awesome. They listened to what I did, asked really solid questions and then told us some of their plans. A lot of what we talked about ended up being included in their official API release. Dan’s brother Kevin O’Neil wrote this relationship and the results up on the CTA Tattler blog: <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/blogs/cta-tattler/2010/09/great-example-of-government-private-cooperation-harper-reed-wins-an-inaugural-mcic-data-innovation-award-for-chicago-transit-api.html">Great example of government-private cooperation: Harper Reed wins award for CTA's Bus Tracker API</a>.</p>

<p>Interacting with the CTA directly and working with them on their app was great. It really demonstrates how a private citizen can affect the mega government type organization to make things better for the future. I don’t think this is an easy pattern to replicate - but it is something to aspire to when hacking/proselytizing open data and open gov type APIs.</p>

The most recent chapter in this story is that the <a href="http://blog.mcic.org/2010/09/mcic-project-prize-takes-a-turn/">MCIC awarded me a Data Innovation Award</a>. I was sadly unable to participate in the award ceremony(I was drinking Chu-Hi in tokyo), but I hear it was awesome. Dan O’Neil was able to pick my award and say some words about what we did.</p>

<p>A lot of people helped make this happen. <a href="http://www.derivativeworks.com/">Dan O’Neil</a> was an inspiration and really helped me figure out a strategy in working with the CTA. The CTA itself was awesome - especially <a href="http://coppoletta.net/">Tony Coppoletta</a> and <a href="http://www.chicago-l.org/">Graham Garfield</a>. Both of those dudes made it easy to work with the CTA and are also sweet guys outside of the CTA.</p>

<p>This has been a really good hack. ;) I am now a data innovator.</p>
