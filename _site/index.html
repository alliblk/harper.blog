<p>I meant to post this months ago. hah. For some reason, it didn&#8217;t quite make it live. Then a couple days ago, I was talking to a friend about his recent move to Lincoln Square. We spent some time talking about great places to go eat and hang out, and I remembered this post. I thought I would get it up and out there.</p>

<p>A couple months ago, Hiromi and I moved from Lincoln Square to Wicker Park. We had wanted to live in Wicker Park for many years and since we have nothing keeping us in Lincoln Square - we decided to go ahead and move.</p>

<p>Lincoln Square was awesome.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed living there for the 3 years we were there. The neighborhood was awesome. The people were great. The nightlife was&#8230; well, there was a bunch of great restaurants. ;)</p>

<p>I wanted to take a minute to chronicle the places we went to a bunch and the places we liked. Hopefully this list will helpful to someone. These are all the places I will miss.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href='http://www.jurysrestaurant.com/'>Jury’s</a> - This place is insane. It has great hamburgers, great food and great service. It also has one of the strangest crowds in Lincoln Square. Always makes me chuckle.</li>

<li><a href='http://www.drewseatery.com/'>Drew’s Eatery</a> - I like drew. He is nice. His eatery is a great place to get an afternoon snack or quick dinner. Very vegan friendly. This is key. They have Italian beef sandwiches. It isn’t often you can go to a vegan friendly place and order an Italian beef sandwich. I enjoy their water in a box.</li>

<li><a href='http://www.theglobepub.com/'>The Globe</a> - I think i went here 500 times for lunch with the SkinnyTech crew. It is a good place to watch people, football, rugby or have cheese fries.</li>

<li><a href='http://www.cafe28.org/'>Cafe28</a> - I love cafe 28. I suggest you go there immediately.</li>

<li><a href='http://www.adeliciousvegancafe.com/'>Delicious Cafe</a> - another vegan friendly place in the area. They have great vegan sandwiches and sweets. They often host dinners and other special vegan events. <em><a href='http://maps.google.com/places/us/il/chicago/w-leland-ave/2308/-rosded-restaurant?gl=us'>Rosded</a> - This is my favorite Thai place. It is cheap, good and small - as all thai places should be.</em></li>

<li><a href='http://www.costellosandwich.com/'>Costellos</a> - makes good sandwiches. We often walked there on an afternoon. It is always packed with families.</li>

<li><a href='http://www.halfacrebeer.com/'>Half Acre Brewery</a> - a recent addition to the neighborhood. It is a great way to grab a growler for a party or BYOB place. <em><a href='http://maps.google.com/places/us/il/chicago/w-montrose-ave/2030/-mythos-restaurant?hl=en&amp;gl=us'>Mythos</a> - Mythos is insane. I love every bit of it. If you are a fan of Greek foods and like BYOB then this place is for you. Mix it with some wine or the aforementioned Half Acre growler.</em></li>

<li><a href='http://www.glennsdiner.com/'>Glenn’s</a> - I think this is one of my favorite places in Lincoln Square. It is hilariously packed. Make a reservation.</li>

<li><a href='http://www.merzapothecary.com/'>Mertz</a> - this is for hiromi and hippies. They have nice soap.</li>

<li><a href='http://store.hazelchicago.com/'>Hazel</a> - A nice gift store/nick nack store. A great place for picking up gifts or party favors. I recommend it. We got many good items here. The people are always nice and they do gift wrapping.</li>

<li><a href='http://www.firstslice.org/'>First Slice cafe</a> - another great lunch spot. Out of the way. tasty and nice.</li>

<li><a href='http://chosunokrestaurant.com/'>Cho Sun Ok</a> - The insane people who went here took ALL of our parking spots, always. But for good reason. this is a great korean place.</li>

<li><a href='http://www.google.com/movies?hl=en&amp;near=Chicago&amp;dq=davis+theatre&amp;theater=davis'>Davis Theatre</a> - It is like a grindhouse theatre mixed with yuppies. A great place to see a cheap movie.</li>
</ul>

<p>I imagine I missed a bunch of great places. If you have any favs, leave them in the comments.</p>

<p>I really like Lincoln Square. I think we would live there again.</p>

<p>On October 28th, I had the pleasure of speaking at the Tech Cocktail Startup Mixology Conference. It was a fun quick conference with a set of amazing speakers.</p>

<p>Below is my talk. I spoke about fostering a community of problem solvers. Here are my <a href='https://docs.google.com/present/view?id=dd3wvxq5_649fzcvqpvz&amp;interval=5&amp;autoStart=true'>slides</a>.</p>

<p>Would love to know your thoughts.</p>

<p>I am excited to see Tech Cocktail grow. I have been going to TC for years now. Threadless sponsored the first TC in boulder, we had tables at various TC&#8217;s in Chicago. Scott and I did a really amazing presentation on printers at the first TC conference. It has been awesome. I can&#8217;t wait to see what Frank has in store for TC next.</p>

<p>For awhile, nobody but us transit nerds paid attention to this api/hack. However, as more and more apps were built and more and more people used those apps - more people started noticing the benefits from the opening of this “api.”</p>

<p>The API got a number of really good write-ups, particularly about how the API was unofficial and how I went around hacking it. The first (and best) was by my good friend Dan X. O’neil: <a href='http://www.derivativeworks.com/2009/01/h.html'>&#8220;The power is not the mashup. It&#8217;s the data.&#8221;</a>. From here a bunch of really great posts popped up talking about the unofficial API and innovation. Joe Hughes blogged about whether the unofficial API is <a href='http://headwayblog.com/2008/12/14/unofficial-cta-apis/'>innovation on borrowed time</a>. Programmable Web <a href='http://blog.programmableweb.com/2009/01/27/hacking-chicagos-unofficial-transit-api/'>summarized Dan’s piece and added some commentary</a>.</p>

<p>In the aforementioned post by Dan O&#8217;Neil, He talks about how we visited the CTA and chatted with them about the API. In the world of litigious organizations and scary governments - working with the CTA was awesome. They listened to what I did, asked really solid questions and then told us some of their plans. A lot of what we talked about ended up being included in their official API release. Dan’s brother Kevin O’Neil wrote this relationship and the results up on the CTA Tattler blog: <a href='http://www.chicagonow.com/blogs/cta-tattler/2010/09/great-example-of-government-private-cooperation-harper-reed-wins-an-inaugural-mcic-data-innovation-award-for-chicago-transit-api.html'>Great example of government-private cooperation: Harper Reed wins award for CTA&#8217;s Bus Tracker API</a>.</p>

<p>Interacting with the CTA directly and working with them on their app was great. It really demonstrates how a private citizen can affect the mega government type organization to make things better for the future. I don’t think this is an easy pattern to replicate - but it is something to aspire to when hacking/proselytizing open data and open gov type APIs.</p>
<a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/5014492675/'><img src='http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4144/5014492675_5a23a61f3a_m.jpg' align='left' width='200' /></a>
<p>The most recent chapter in this story is that the <a href='http://blog.mcic.org/2010/09/mcic-project-prize-takes-a-turn/'>MCIC awarded me a Data Innovation Award</a>. I was sadly unable to participate in the award ceremony(I was drinking Chu-Hi in tokyo), but I hear it was awesome. Dan O’Neil was able to pick my award and say some words about what we did.</p>

<p>A lot of people helped make this happen. <a href='http://www.derivativeworks.com/'>Dan O’Neil</a> was an inspiration and really helped me figure out a strategy in working with the CTA. The CTA itself was awesome - especially <a href='http://coppoletta.net/'>Tony Coppoletta</a> and <a href='http://www.chicago-l.org/'>Graham Garfield</a>. Both of those dudes made it easy to work with the CTA and are also sweet guys outside of the CTA.</p>

<p>This has been a really good hack. ;) I am now a data innovator.</p>

<p>I am excited to be a part of Venture Hacks helping them find amazing startups for the <a href='http://angel.co'>Angels on the Angellist</a>. The scout program is going to be a lot of fun and hopefully will allow some great startups to be funded by the amazing angels from the angel list. Check out this <a href='http://gigaom.com/2010/08/31/angellist-designates-scouts-to-refer-new-startup-deals/'>great write up in GigaOm</a>.</p>

<p>If you have a startup that you want to submit to the angellist, you can do so yourself by <a href='http://angel.co/intro'>submitting directly to the angel list</a>. If you want more information about the angel list, or would like me to take a look at your startup (and get all the perks of interacting with a person as amazing as myself - hah) - then send an <a href='http://harperreed.org/contact'>email to me directly</a>. I am pretty easy to contact and can help out in many ways.</p>

<p>I am looking to help out and interact with midwest startups. I am very serious about making sure that Chicago continues to be a good place to be an entrepreneur. Having venturehack/angel list representation in Chicago will continue to help the community. Be sure an check out the <a href='http://angel.co/chicago'>listing for Chicago Angels</a>.</p>

<p>Making the Midwest/Chicago a great place for starting a company isn’t just for people like myself, the <a href='http://www.lightbank.com'>groupon guys</a>, <a href='http://www.sandboxindustries.com'>sandbox</a> and the angels. It is about the entrepreneur as well. Please let me know if you have ideas, concerns or just general insights into making the Midwest/Chicago the best place to start a company.</p>

<p>If you are outside of the Chicago/Midwest area - feel free to ping me anyway. I am always looking for new startups to talk to and people to connect.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t like to move my blog around. It is super annoying. The RSS feed gets all messed up, I spend months tweaking everything. I find silly bugs and then fascinate about fixing them. All in all it takes months to complete the process. I avoid it like the plague.</p>

<p>However, I really wanted something simpler than wordpress. I didn’t need a CMS. I barely need a blogging engine. I update so infrequently. I want something that creates well formed html (hah), static content and is easy to use.</p>

<p>I started looking into hosting this blog on Google’s app engine awhile ago. I looked into <a href='http://bloog.billkatz.com/' title='Bloog'>Bloog</a> - an awesome restful bloggin engine for app engine. It was very hopeful. i spent a bunch of time hacking on it and eventually ported my theme over. I didn’t feel it though. it worked well. it had all the features i wanted. It even used a bunch of neat app engine tricks. I gave up on using it for my blog. It just wasn’t the correct choice.</p>

<p>During this time, I watched most of my hackerish friends start to use Jekyll to power their blogs (or write and then use <a href='http://github.com/aconbere/igor' title='igor'>igor</a> as <a href='http://anders.conbere.org/'>anders</a> did (protip: do not search for “anders jekyll” in google)). I admired the simplicity of the jekyll engine. It was so easy and fun to use. I wanted to use it for my blog - but it didn’t play as nicely with app engine as i had hoped.</p>

<p>I then found Drydrop.</p>

<p>DryDrop is a neat application for app engine that let’s you host static content. In my current phase of life, I really hate managing servers. It is fun and all - but if i don’t have to - i am not going to. ;) Instead, I try and use platform as a service services(<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAS_syndrome'>heh</a>) to minimize the number of servers that I touch on a daily basis (my current server number is 4 (I secretly want it to grow back to 100+)). DryDrop was a nice solution for my server hatred. It allowed me to serve simple static content on app engine. I immediately ported a bunch of my static sites over to app engine: <a href='http://www.harpercloud.com/'>harpercloud.com</a>, <a href='http://www.biofuelmenace.com/'>biofuelmenace.com</a>, <a href='http://weownthesun.com'>weownthesun.com</a> and of course <a href='http://www.ryankanno.com'>ryankanno.com</a>.</p>

<p>After a few weeks with these sites on app engine - I decided that it was probably the right place to put my precious blog.</p>

<p><a href='http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/'>Jekyll</a> is an interesting beast. It is exactly as the wiki proclaims: <a href='http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll/'>a simple, blog aware, static site generator</a>. It has no features (well. a couple), it has no built in community aspects (no commenting, trackbacks, reactions, etc). It doesn’t have any admin. it is just a static site generator that is geared for blog like sites. It works amazingly.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was port my theme over to Jekyll. You can check this out at my <a href='http://github.com/harperreed/harperreed-blog'>blogs git repository</a>. It was a pain in the ass, but i was able to clean up a bunch of annoying HTML issues that i had from changing shit all the time. I still need to refactor it a bunch.</p>

<p>Once the theme was done, I started working on the content. This is the biggest issue. I have a bunch of content. Like 1000s of posts. Jekyll is not necessarily the quickest of generators when you have thousands of posts. Luckily I was able to do some simple tricks to ensure that the old posts work and the new posts work as well. Its honestly pretty annoying and i need to solve this better.</p>

<p>A couple hints for hosting Jekyll on App Engine with DryDrop:</p>

<ul>
<li>check out <a href='http://thelab.carlsverre.com/2010/02/09/static-hosting'>this post</a> by <a href='http://www.carlsverre.com/'>Carl Sverre</a> on tweaking the site.yaml file for drydrop to handle the pretty permalinks</li>

<li>the wordpress migration script that jekyll uses is pretty nice. i <a href='http://github.com/harperreed/harperreed-blog/blob/master/_import/wordpress.rb'>hacked mine to export tags and datetime</a> as well.</li>

<li>there are hundreds of blog posts just like this one. they all have great hints</li>

<li>if you get stuck, just check out the <a href='http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll/sites'>list of sites that are using jekyll</a>. Often they have source on github. you can glean all sorts of goodness from them.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>It is a bummer to leave wordpress.</strong></p>

<p>I have been on wordpress since early 2005. I think that is the longest I have stayed with 1 piece of software. I really enjoy the <a href='http://wordpress.org/support/'>wordpress community</a>. I really like <a href='http://ma.tt/'>matt</a> and all he has done for open source and the internet. I like the <a href='http://drewblas.com/2010/07/15/an-analysis-of-gpled-code-in-thesis/'>fights they pick</a> and i enjoy the <a href='http://buddypress.org/'>innovations they are bringing to blogging</a>. I don’t like having to <a href='http://www.google.com/search?q=wordpress+exploit'>fight hackers</a> off every single day. If there was one reason i am abandoning wordpress it is because of the hackers.</p>

<p>I hosted about 25 wordpress blogs on my mosso account for various friends. I kept most of them up to date, but a lot of them were for friends and were not under my control. 100% of them got owned. hah. It was just something they did. no matter how fast or often i updated the wordpress software - it would be owned at least one time. My personal blog was safe for some reason. Maybe it was because I always ran the bleeding edge version from SVN. I will not miss the constant updates and the attacks. The wordpress community does a good job of handling this issue. I, however, was tired of it.</p>

<p>I migrated at least 22 of the 25 hosted blogs to <a href='http://wordpress.com'>wordpress.com</a> or <a href='http://posterous.com'>posterous</a>. I killed all the unused wordpress installs. No more hackers getting in through plugins, themes or trickery.</p>

<p>If i were to use wordpress again, I would either use <a href='http://wordpress.com'>wordpress.com</a> or <a href='http://vaultpress.com/'>vaultpress</a>. Both of those products seem to solve my problems. Right now, however, jekyll has pretty thoroughly solved them.</p>

<p>I can’t wait to start updating this blog a bit more often. I don’t know if i will write like i did in <a href='/2003/'>2003</a>/<a href='/2004/'>2004</a> - but i plan to update it a bit more than i did in <a href='/2009/'>2009</a>. We shall see ;)</p>

<p>The iPad is a new and very exciting paradigm for computing. I played with it afternoon and it felt very minority report. It felt like the future. no physical keyboard. I was controlling things with my finger/mind. it was awesome. I am smitten.</p>

<p>Besides the irrational distortion field emitted by this shiny device, I have some general thoughts/complaints on the iPad. <ol>
	<li><strong>The lack of camera is irrational.</strong> I have no idea why apple didn't include two cameras on the iPad. It would be an amazing device for parents, students, people, etc. Chatting is annoying on non-multitasking devices, however it might be nice to Skype with a slate like device. It will obviously be added to the next iteration of this device.</li>
	<li><strong>The iWork cloud platform is annoying.</strong> Importing and exporting documents is very hard. It is obviously not meant to be used by people who have documents already. The only way to get shit on the device is to download it. Why wouldn't Apple integrate iWork with MobileMe? silly. Google will have to change their Docs platform to allow easy downloading from the mobile google docs page.</li>
	<li><strong>The lack of any clock or alarm app very strange.</strong> I use the clock app on the iphone for a lot of stuff. not having that is a bummer. but in the grand scheme of bummers its about a 0.00001/5.</li>
	<li><strong>There is no usb host mode</strong> (that i know of). I would love to charge my phone, etc via USB with this device. it would minimize the number of cables and what not i would bring. It would also be awesome to plugin external disks or keyboards to it.</li>
	<li><strong>Google Reader blows on the iPad.</strong> This is a real bummer since that is pretty much the one thing i want to have all the time. You can't scroll with the desktop version and the mobile version seems silly on the iPad. I can't wait for Google to "fix" all of their webapps for the iPad.</li>
	<li><strong>Using an iPhone after spending a lot of time on the iPad makes the iPhone seem like a midget</strong>. It makes the nexus one seems like it is made out of paper.</li>
	<li><strong>The iPad is probably one of the coolest ways to show presentations to someone while sitting at a bar.</strong> I have been pitching some ideas to people and having the iPad with my deck is pretty awesome. A great way to go over your presentation with one or two people. Way better than a laptop.</li>
	<li><strong>The Kindle app is awesome</strong>. I like it a lot. I want to try reading a book on the iPad, but i really like the kindle's screen.</li>
	<li><strong>Most of the apps are boring.</strong> Seriously. The apps that are impressive are: Kayak, Maps, Photos, Kindle, Twitterrific, instapaper, Netflix and Square</li>
	<li><strong><a href='https://squareup.com/'>Square</a> is one of the coolest apps I have seen.</strong> It should blow peoples minds. I imagine that it will be a game changer for friends who do retail. I can't wait for my square card reader to show up. I will be charging my friends for everything.</li>
	<li><strong>This is an amazing device for casual internet use.</strong> I imagine that Hiromi, my parents, my brother and anyone else who isn't attached to a computer all day long would love these devices.</li>
</ol> Overall the iPad is amazing. I can&#8217;t wait to see how developers iterate on the platform and create really nifty applications. It will also be fun to see what features Apple magically unlocks on the iPad.</p>

<p>I am going to try and build some applications now. If you have ideas - let me know.</p>

<blockquote>I wrote most of this entry the day before the earthquake in Haiti. It was motivated by the magicJack announcement and my interest in mobile devices within developing nations.  However, the thoughts in this post suddenly seemed more real after I started hearing reports of communication breakdown after the earthquake.</blockquote><strong>The femtocell</strong>
<p>At the recent CES, the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MagicJack'>magicJack company</a> announced that they wanted to release a consumer grade FemtoCell device as an upgrade to their USB FXO/Softphone device.  Note: magicJack is an insane company. You probably have seen them on television commercials while watching USA &#8216;Up All Night&#8217;.  While these commercials almost seem scam-like, they have apparently sold 5 million USB magicJacks.  That&#8217;s a lot of phone calls!</p>

<p>A femtocell device is basically a mini GSM/CDMA tower. Think of it as a wi-fi AP but instead of wi-fi - it is GSM. You could drop it into your house, plug it into the Internet, and suddenly get 5 bars of connectivity on your mobile handset - instead of the standard AT&#38;T 1 bar. magicJack is offering the same service the USB dongle provides (unlimited calling and what not), but for mobile phones.  As a consumer, you would need to configure your handset to use the magicJack femtocell to receive/send calls.  When you are in range of the device (w/ signal strength enough to cover ~3000 sq. ft. house), you would bypass your carrier and use the magicJack for all incoming and outgoing calls. AWESOME.  Especially with the likes of Google Voice.</p>

<p>There are questions on the legality of such a device - but it is apparently legal to use inside your residence.</p>

<p>Side note: <a href='http://www.google.com/search?q=magicjack+sip'>Magicjack is SIP</a>. And <a href='http://magicjackhacks.com/'>hackable</a>. There is a cat and mouse game being played out trying to unlock it.  You can even use it with <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk_(PBX)'>Asterisk</a>.</p>
<strong>The thoughts</strong>
<p>So I began to think.  Femtocells could be used to open up mobile VOIP.  One scenario is that you could jump on a 3rd party carrier for a limited time to make a p2p VOIP call using your current GSM/WCDMA mobile device.  That is really awesome.  More importantly, what&#8217;s REALLY awesome is the pirate (3rd party) carriers.</p>

<p>Imagine purchasing 100 <a href='http://www.nata2.org/2010/01/17/i-love-phones-designed-for-developing-countries/'>Motorola F3</a>&#8217;s, a <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnu_radio'>GNU Radio USRP2</a> (~$1400) running the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenBTS'>OpenBTS stack</a> and a super huge antenna - and suddenly becoming a rural/developing country mobile provider. Or - if you&#8217;re more interested in being a pirate carrier - you could run this setup in a city and be a carrier for the dark side (drugs, gangs, nerds&#8230;). This inexpensive setup is available (and achievable) today!  In case of the apocalypse/disaster/camping/nerdcamp - I think it would be nice to have a set up to deploy to organize/help people.</p>

<p>My mind started to work into overtime.  I began thinking about the ramifications of hacking the magicJack. Wouldn&#8217;t it be neat to use femtocell technology to distribute ad hoc mobile carriers around a neighborhood/disaster area/rural/developing country?  You could hook the magicJack femtocell up to a <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FON#Fonera_2.0n'>Fon2 device (usb/linux/broadband)</a> and distribute them around in places with connectivity. All you would need is a better antenna and some software to manage the provisioning and device identification. BAM! Instant pirate P2P GSM carrier.</p>

<p>I am hoping that this type of convergence will lead us <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088763/'>to the future</a>.</p>

<a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/4283555038/' title='Nokia 1100 and Motorola F3 by nata2, on Flickr'><img src='http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4039/4283555038_a798542c5f_m.jpg' height='218' align='right' alt='Nokia 1100 and Motorola F3' width='240' /></a>
<p>I love mobile phones. I don&#8217;t know why - but mobile devices represent so much of what I love about technology. The ubiquity, the fascination, all the new technology that pops up and all the different way people use their devices. I also feel like mobile devices will be the future of whatever the internet turns out to be. They will power the internet. With all this in mind - I have started to become interested in the devices that fill the opposite niche. The devices that are SO simple that their are almost NO features.</p>

<p>These are not Razrs, or other shitty mobile devices which act like they have all sorts of amazing features.  These specific phones are single feature, cheap devices and are often deployed in developing countries.</p>

<p>There are two that I really enjoy and I suggest checking out.</p>

<p>The first is the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_1100'>Nokia 1100</a>. Also known as my favorite phone in the world. I first saw this phone while working for <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/sets/72057594078282161/'>a minute in Bangalore</a>. It was advertised as a phone &#8221;<a href='http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/india/article.cfm?articleid=4358'>made for india</a>&#8221; and apparently was hardy enough to be used by the working class there. I was drawn to the device. I neeeeeded it. It&#8217;s weird, because at the time I was running a symbian device that supported about every possible feature available in mobile - so thinking about jumping to a mobile device that was pretty much featureless was crazy. But - I was compelled.</p>

<p>The phone isn&#8217;t that fancy. It has very few features. It is super tiny and is super cheap. It is just a basic, simple phone that does nothing more than look &#8220;Nokia&#8221; and probably makes calls. The features it has are incredibly handy: flashlight, alarm clock and sms messaging.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t realize it then, but the Nokia 1100 is possibly the most popular electronic device in the world. According to the infallible wikipedia: Nokia has sold ~200 million of the Nokia 1100s since it&#8217;s launch in 2003. To put it in perspective - there have been ~30MM iPhones sold and ~50MM Razrs sold.</p>

<p>I eventually got a couple of these and used them as lenders, experiments and generaly fucking around phones. I even sent one to my brother for him to use - which he eventually washed in a washing machine - it still boots. They are HARDY. and 20 bucks.</p>

<p>The second phone that I am interested in is a bit newer and is a bit more tech. The <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_FONE_F3'>Motorola F3</a>. My buddy <a href='http://thinkmoreinc.wordpress.com/2009/03/19/50-2/'>Hemmant showed it to me</a>, told me a bit about the history and I couldn&#8217;t stop thinking about it. Anecdotally, this phone was made by a Motorola team in india - again for use in the developing countries market. It is simple, has no features (even less than the 1100) and is JUST a phone. There is one major differentiator. The Motorola f3 is one of the only phones to have an e-ink display. This means that it uses very little power in standby (standby time of ~17 days), can be used in low light/no light situations and is rather resilient. The phone didn&#8217;t sell as many as the Nokia 1100 - in fact it was a veritable failure.</p>

<p>The F3 has no features. It barely send txt messages. It has voice prompts for all menus. It is just a phone. A user serviceable, easy to charge, thin, e-ink phone. It works well making calls and receiving txt messages. The F3 would be an amazing phone for a child, elderly person or someone who doesn&#8217;t want to deal with learning pesky features. I got one for my &#8220;go bag&#8221; as an emergency phone (I am not a survivalist, I just crush a lot).</p>

<p>You can find an unlocked <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013A7KMW?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=nata2productions&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0013A7KMW'>Motorola f3 for about 30 bucks on amazon</a>. I suggest you get one.</p>

However, I am an equal opportunity hosting consumer. I will try and be as open as possible (but probably a bit biased as well). This is on my personal blog and does not represent Rackspace in the least. These opinions are mine and do not represent Rackspace in anyway.</em></blockquote>
<p>I guess I will go ahead and jump in. This is based on what I use and would most likely suggest if we were drinking beers and talking about hosting. Your mileage may vary. I am sorry if I end up causing a nuclear war based on these recommendations.</p>
<strong>"Platforms"</strong>
<p>Two platforms are really getting me going these days. Google&#8217;s App Engine and Heroku.</p>

<p>App Engine is known by my close friends as my true love (haha. second only to <a href='http://hiromiusagi.com'>my lovely wife</a>). I spend almost 90% of my development time hacking on App Engine apps (<a href='http://Excla.im'>Excla.im</a>, <a href='http://CityPayments.org'>CityPayments</a>, <a href='http://ChicagoAlerts.org'>ChicagoAlerts</a>, <a href='http://chicagowiki.transitapi.com/'>Transitapi</a>, <a href='http://AwesomeUpdater.com'>AwesomeUpdater</a>, and <a href='http://harpersfriends.com'>Harper's Friends</a>). App Engine does a few things very well and allows the developer to do the rest. Quite a few of the lessons I learned while scaling out Threadless are baked into the app by default. You don&#8217;t have to scale all the pieces independently and you can really take care of things all at once. I recommend it and use it for prototyping and building new apps.</p>
<a href='http://Heroku.com'>Heroku</a>
<p>If you are interested in <a href='http://www.djangoproject.com'>Django</a>, Ruby/Rails or JVM languages (I am looking at you <a href='http://www.scala-lang.org/node/1831'>Scala</a>!) - I highly recommend App Engine or Heroku.</p>
<strong>"Cloud" Server Providers</strong>
<p>Cloud Servers are amazing things. Usually they are <a href='http://xen.org/'>XEN</a> hosted and wrapped by an API or a nice pretty interface. I &#60;3 them. If I would have had these server options in 2001 I would have been able to make the server kingdom I dreamt about. It would be awesome. Luckily, now in 2009/2010 I can build my server kingdom in the <a href='http://www.nepholologist.com/'>CLOUDS</a>. Anyway&#8230;.</p>
<a href='http://www.slicehost.com/'>Slicehost</a><a href='http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/'>EC2</a>
<p>Sidenote: <a href='http://www.linode.com/?r=1762fce92f905a07a8623481199299b3ab8a90b9'>Linode</a> is getting a lot of buzz based on their <a href='http://blog.linode.com/2009/12/04/linode-stomps-competition-in-performance-benchmark/'>performance/cost ratio</a>. I recommend you <a href='http://www.linode.com/?r=1762fce92f905a07a8623481199299b3ab8a90b9'>take a look</a> at them and see if they will work for you.</p>

<p>If you do find yourself in the dark world of cloud servers, you should check out my favorite utility for managing all things servers: <a href='https://www.cloudkick.com/'>CloudKick</a>. CloudKick is a pretty solid app that allows you manage your all your Rackspace and Amazon servers. You can do it very easily and with very few buttons (I love a small amount of buttons).</p>

<p>If you are looking for awesome easy servers - use Rackspace Cloud Servers. If you are looking for a full stack (load balancer, block storage and what not) - use Amazon. I use Rackspace Cloud Servers.</p>
<strong>File Hosting and Serving.</strong>
<p>File hosting is simple stuff. I follow this simple guideline:</p>

<p>If you want to host a file for everyone (i.e. a popular image, a iso, download etc) where performance is important - use <a href='http://www.rackspacecloud.com/cloud_hosting_products/files'>Rackspace Cloud Files</a> with limelight integration. This is the closest you will come to paying for enterprise CDN capabilities for a tiny amount of money. You can&#8217;t beat the level of performance that <a href='http://www.limelightnetworks.com/'>limelight</a> offers (unless you want to pay for <a href='http://www.akamai.com'>Akamai</a>).</p>

<p>If you need to put a BUNDLE of files somewhere that needs to be public or private - use Cloud Files or <a href='http://aws.amazon.com/s3/'>S3</a>. Depending entirely on what vendor you like or what API you are most familiar with. I use both for backing up various data from my servers and home (I recommend <a href='http://www.s3rsync.com/'>s3sync</a>, <a href='http://code.google.com/p/s3fs/'>s3fs</a> for S3 or <a href='http://westhoffswelt.de/projects/mossofs.html'>MossoFS</a>, <a href='http://blog.chmouel.com/2009/09/02/rsync-like-backup-to-rackspace-cloud-file-with-duplicity/'>CloudFiles/Duplicity</a> for Cloud Files).</p>
<strong>Multi Tenant/Shared Hosting.</strong>
<p>Shared hosting is such a pain in the ass. ;) I really don&#8217;t like it. However, I use it because of the price and because of how easy it is to host stuff for friends and others.</p>

<p>I use two providers regularly for shared hosting:</p>
<a href='http://www.webfaction.com/?affiliate=harper'>Webfaction</a><a href='http://www.rackspacecloud.com/cloud_hosting_products/sites'>Rackspace Cloud Sites</a>
<p>If file storage is just what you need - then check out <a href='http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?159982'>Dreamhost</a>. For the love of god they have cheap prices. I looked today and they were offering unlimited everything (that doesn&#8217;t make sense). The only problem is that they don&#8217;t allow you to use it as a backup service (y<a href='http://www.labnol.org/internet/backup-files-on-dreamhost-web-hosting-servers/4538/'>ou have to use the space in a very specific way</a>).</p>
<strong>Enterprise/Physical Servers.</strong>
<p>Enterprise servers are easy. You use <a href='http://www.rackspace.com/'>Rackspace</a>. ;) Seriously though - while at <a href='http://threadless.com/'>Threadless</a>, Rackspace saved our asses more than once. Using Rackspace allowed us to concentrate on our application rather than concentrate on our servers. Although they can be expensive - they offer so much that it is often worth it.</p>

<p>If you are looking for something a bit cheaper or a bit more hands on, I suggest my favorite chicago hosting company: <a href='http://fdcservers.net/'>FDCServers.net</a>. They offer great support and cheap servers. You are not going to get near the support that Rackspace offers, but you are going to pay a LOT less. I host a couple big apps at FDC and have had no problems at all.</p>
<strong>Conclusion.</strong>
<p>This wraps up my hosting review. I recommend App Engine, Cloud Servers, Cloudfiles/S3 and Rackspace Managed hosting. heh. See - super easy. All your hosting questions are answered.</p>

<p>2010 is going to be an exciting year. I imagine that Rackspace and Amazon will continue to fight head to head. Which will only make us consumers have better options. I also am very excited to see what Google does with App Engine (I imagine that they will NOT be adding <a href='http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=13'>PHP support</a>). I hope that 2010 is as productive as 2009 was for hosting, if so - then it will be an exciting, innovative time.</p>

<p>Leave your questions in the comments - I will attempt to answer them the best i can.</p>
