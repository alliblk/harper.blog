<strong>Hi.</strong> I am an engineer who builds paradigm-shifting tech and leads others to do the same. I love using the enormity of the Internet to bring people together, whether as CTO of Obama for America, CTO at Threadless.com, or on my own projects. You can often find me playing with new technology, looking for something to hack, or enjoying life in Chicago with my amazing wife, Hiromi. Check out my <a href="http://harperreed.com">homepage</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=harper" target="_blank">follow me on twitter</a>.

  <div class="postcontent">
    <p>Everyone at worked has been talking about <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0411008/">Lost</a> incessantly since I started working at <a href="http://skinnycorp.com">skinnyCorp</a>. It was driving me mad - mostly because they kept talking about all sorts or interesting things. Things that didn't make sense and it was completely infuriating. I was completely taken in, without even seeing or knowing anything about it. The final straw was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lost_Experience">alternative reality game</a> the <a href="http://www.4815162342.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=23291">Lost people</a> put on. It was absolutely madness. I love viral marketing and that was amazing. It was so deep and incredible. And after <a href="http://jacobdehart.com">Jacob</a> sent me links to all the websites and what not I decided I had to watch it. sadly I didn't want to just jump in. I needed to start from the beginning. </p>


<p> <p>So Jacob lent me season one of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_%282004%29">Lost</a> to watch. Originally I started watching it by myself, much to the chagrin of my roommates who all decided early on that Lost was a terrible idea and should never be watched by anyone. Well they all changed their tune (except for Chris - he has stayed strong). So we watched season one. Then a few weeks went by and we watched it again. So finally I decided to buy season two and check it out. </p> <p>So this weekend, I watched season two. Well not all of it. but a bundle of it. It is really awesome. I honestly prefer season one thus far - it had more mystery and more intrigue. I feel the story line is a bit stronger. But season two is pretty awesome.&nbsp; I absolutely HATE <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0735442/">Michelle Rodriguez's</a> character. Seriously. I hate her. I hate most of her characters and this particular character just kills me. I really wish the season would hurry up so I don't have to deal with her any longer. </p> <p>Lost is so full of mystery. Its amazing. My only problem with it - is actually with wikipedia. Such a vast of knowledge about the show. Its like my <a href="http://imdb.com/">IMDB</a> addiction - where I can't help but look up everything about the movie I am watching - while watching it. It is awesome. But with <a href="http://imdb.com/">IMDB</a> - you just get info that rather high level: trivia, actors, and whatnot; but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characters_of_Lost">wikipedia</a> - man, that place is FULL of spoilers. I really have to keep myself from reading the synopsis of all of the episodes while I am watching it. It kills me. I feel it is akin to reading the end of a book before finishing it. </p> <p>by the way, I hate watching television. I don't mind movies - but seriously I feel so dirty. I hate it. So hopefully, this show will end easily and soon.</p></p>
