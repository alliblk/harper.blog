<strong>Hi.</strong> I am an engineer who builds paradigm-shifting tech and leads others to do the same. I love using the enormity of the Internet to bring people together, whether as CTO of Obama for America, CTO at Threadless.com, or on my own projects. You can often find me playing with new technology, looking for something to hack, or enjoying life in Chicago with my amazing wife, Hiromi.

  <div class="postcontent">
    <p>Tonight while talking about my crazy hair in high school and showing my roommate chris some pictures from high school i stumbled upon all my old tickets from concents and what not from the past 16 years. I apparently have gone to an ass load of concerts. Maybe over 150. It was surpriseing to look at all of these tickets and realize that i have spent at least 3 hours if not more time per piece of paper. that is roughly 450 hours of music - a lot of it death metal. haha. awesome.</p>

<p>One thing that is pretty funny for me - is all the tickets i have where i didn't make it to the concert. I have not made good choices in regards which concerts i didn't go to. For instance, i went to 3 cannibal corpse concerts but i didn't make it to the sonic youth show with guided by voices. Or i ended up seeing busta rhymes twice but i missed lyrics born. Or i saw appleseed cast but i didn't take the time to see white stripes. haha. The worst one - was when i accidently didn't go see built to spill. I was at dinner at my friend lavi's house and i we had just finished eating dinner. We were all hanging out and i noticed a friend wasn't there (in retrospect it could have been my now coworker jeffrey - but i am not quite sure - and my memory is hazy surrounding all things lavi). Anyway, i remember asking where he was and they were like "oh. at the built to spill concert." Well i was quite surprised. because i LOVED built to spill then. LOVED. like my favorite band. so missing it was quite a bummer. But not only missing it - but completely forgetting. man. i was bummed. but.. luckily for me.. i was able to keep cool.</p>

<p>Heh. i was doing this sporadically enough that i had to stop buying tickets. haha. so now i need a calendar. and usually someone else buys the tickets and keeps me in line. haha.Â  man. sometimes i am retarded. but luckily not retarded enough to lose my fingers while juggling knives.</p>

<p>wtf.</p>

<p>exactly.</p>
