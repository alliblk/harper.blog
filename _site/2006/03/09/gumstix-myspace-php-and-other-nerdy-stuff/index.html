<strong>Hi.</strong> I am an engineer who builds paradigm-shifting tech and leads others to do the same. I love using the enormity of the Internet to bring people together, whether as CTO of Obama for America, CTO at Threadless.com, or on my own projects. You can often find me playing with new technology, looking for something to hack, or enjoying life in Chicago with my amazing wife, Hiromi. Check out my <a href="http://harperreed.com">homepage</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=harper" target="_blank">follow me on twitter</a>.

    <p>The last couple weeks have been ultra nerdy. It has been great. I got my gumstix and have been rocking that - attempting to get a handle on how i am going to make that work. It doesn't seem like it will be all that hard to theoretically make. I am worried about having to prototype a daughterboard for the gunmstix - since i haven't ever really made a circuit board in real life. i mean - i made stuff in college, but it was all in theory and never left the computer. Check out my progress at <a href="http://www.ambientagent.com">ambientagent.com</a>.</p>

<p>On monday in a fit of scattered experimentation i went ahead and created a fake myspace account purely to see how many friend i could get in a day. I signed up and immediately added myself to one of those rediculous friend trains. It is basically a website where you submit your myspace uin and it lists it in a bulletin that you are able to post to myspace. once you are added to the bulletin - then others add you to their account. Using this i was able to get an amazing number of "friends" in 24 hours. In the end i had about 242 friends. Hah. So i made a simple myspace train myself - <a href="http://www.bitchmech.com">bitchmech.com</a>. It has yet to gain the momentum i think it needs - but its hilarious. someday. i will have 1 million friends.</p>

<p>So i have been working on creating a dope php application framework. I have giving my first draft to <a href="http://www.broox.com">derek</a> and am waiting his response.  someday broox and i will create something interesting. hopefully it will also make us 1 million dollars. one for each of my fake myspace friends.</p>

<p>I am writing a 3 part blog about podcasting over at the <a href="http://www.skinnycorp.com/blog/">skinnyBlog</a>. Check it out here: <span /><a href="http://www.skinnycorp.com/blog/14/how_we_podcast_part_1_3_the_equipment">How we podcast. Part 1/3: The equipment</a>. I am going over our journey creating our podcast and what we do to make it oh so good.  It will be awesome. Tomorrow I will be covering our studio and then later i will be covering the podcast structure and design. We are podcasting professionals. hah.</p>

<p>I leave for Tokyo in a week. I am rather exciting. It will be really nice to see hiromi. i miss her quite a bit and would love it if she lived around here. but our world of sip phones and internet chatting is going to have to do for a minute. stupid ocean.</p>

<p>I think i am going to import some old pictures into flickr.
orgazmo is an amazing movie.</p>
