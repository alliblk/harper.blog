<strong>Hi.</strong> I am an engineer who builds paradigm-shifting tech and leads others to do the same. I love using the enormity of the Internet to bring people together, whether as CTO of Obama for America, CTO at Threadless.com, or on my own projects. You can often find me playing with new technology, looking for something to hack, or enjoying life in Chicago with my amazing wife, Hiromi. Check out my <a href="http://harperreed.com">homepage</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=harper" target="_blank">follow me on twitter</a>.

  <div class="postcontent">
    <p>I am watching the <a href="http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/">bbs documentary</a>. Its amazing. I started watching clive barker's Lord of Illusions - but it sucked. It always sucked. It sucked when i saw it in the theatre and it sucks now. So as soon as i remembered that it blew - i also remembered how awesome the BBS Doc was. So i put it in and now it is awesome. AWESOME i say.</p>

<p>I kinda want to run a bbs on one of my boxes. probably synchronet. If anyone wants in - leave a comment and i will hook it up. I think it will be mainly a way to irc. and play door games ;)</p>

<p>So tonight was a night of synchronicity. I started out reading dune. I ordered it and it arrived friday. I finished it this afternoon. It was amazing.  I remember my dad mentioning it when i was a kid - but for some reason i never wanted to read it. Until i was tired of all the books i had sitting by my bed. So <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(novel)">dune</a> was amazing. AMAZING. I totally understand why it was so popular. I am weighing whether i should read that rest of the books by Frank Herbert. I am not really into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_Universe">dune universe</a> at all - just the initial story.</p>

<p>I love wikipedia. What is right about it is all that is wrong with the commercial encyclopedias. What is wrong with it - is what is right about all the pay sites. lame.</p>

<p>So anyway. Tonight and how things work. So after dune was finished, i went to subT to watch <a href="http://www.americanfuckingheritage.com/">american heritage</a> play for their record release party. I bought their cd and their awesome shirt. It ruled. While their i saw my buddy choke and we hung out. Talked cabinets with one of his band mates and just chilled. Then while walking home i ran into jordan and used his +1 for the soulwax/2manydjs party. So good. I was very very surprised.</p>

<p>Now back to the BBS Doc. hah.</p>
