<strong>Hi.</strong> I am an engineer who builds paradigm-shifting tech and leads others to do the same. I love using the enormity of the Internet to bring people together, whether as CTO of Obama for America, CTO at Threadless.com, or on my own projects. You can often find me playing with new technology, looking for something to hack, or enjoying life in Chicago with my amazing wife, Hiromi. Check out my <a href="http://harperreed.com">homepage</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=harper" target="_blank">follow me on twitter</a>.

    <p>Watch this <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xa3ud_limage-parfaite">french commercial.</a> I found it rather nice. In a sad sort of way. I like stuff like this. </p>


<p> <p>The last couple nights, I have watched the <a href="http://www.lordoftherings.net/">lord the rings trilogy</a>. It is pretty awesome. I love it. I bought all the movies when they came out and had watched them sporadically after I owned them. But it is nice to sit and watch them in close proximity to the last one. </p> <p>I am scared of reading <a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=count+of+monte+cristo%20&amp;spell=1&amp;oi=spell">count of monte cristo</a>. It seems as though it will be a rough book. I hope it is really awesome. It is gigantic. Seriously the biggest book ever. I think that I will need a bigger bag to carry it to work. hah. </p> <p>I am seriously considering building out a <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/">mythTV pvr</a>. It seems to be awesome. I really want to use <a href="http://torrentocracy.com/blog/">torrentocracy</a> to download TV shows easily and watch them on my TV. It will be awesome. The only worry I have is that it would grow to be very expensive. I don't want to spend a lot of money. I mean&nbsp; - I would love to have a DVD jukebox and to be able to watch videos and such I download from youtube on my TV. But I don't want to spend more than a couple hundred dollars - at the most. I really would like to use the hardware I currently have. Which I think I could use. I have an old hauppauge card and a desktop box that isn't doing anything. I could get a new case and drop it in there. Or I could wait until the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/09/12/hands-on-with-the-apple-itv-prototype/">ITV from apple</a> comes out and use that. But I might not be able to watch democracy downloads that way. </p> <p>Hmm. the choices. </p> <p>In other sad news - my N70 may have died. Which means I will have to use the E61, which I love, but it has no camera. and I love taking pictures. hmm. I wonder.... </p></p>
