<strong>Hi.</strong> I am an engineer who builds paradigm-shifting tech and leads others to do the same. I love using the enormity of the Internet to bring people together, whether as CTO of Obama for America, CTO at Threadless.com, or on my own projects. You can often find me playing with new technology, looking for something to hack, or enjoying life in Chicago with my amazing wife, Hiromi. Check out my <a href="http://harperreed.org">homepage</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=harper" target="_blank">follow me on twitter</a>.

  <div class="postcontent">
    <p>So I canceled directTV awhile back and have been struggling to figure out how to easily download the shows I want to watch. I would love to do it legally. I have looked into the itunes solution - but they don't have all I need/want. And it won't work for hiromi - in japan. So I needed something that wasn't region specific and something that wasn't hard.</p>

<p>With these requirements I poked around quite a bit. Having looked into <a href="http://www.azaurus.com/">azaurus</a> and <a href="http://www.bittorrent.com/">bittorrent</a> with RSS. It was a pain and I couldn't possibly use it regularly. I also have terrible luck over time with azaurus. It rules when I have time - but when I leave for a week and comeback to it - I have no idea what's going on. So - I then looked into DDL sites. They were lame and too much work. So annoying.</p>

<p>I had great hope in the allsimps.com site. But it was taken down. weird I know.</p>

<p>Finally after looking and looking - I found what I was looking for in a video client that I had already looked into. I had originally downloaded and played with the Democracy video client years ago. It wasn't very intuitive. Or maybe I wasn't into it. But regardless - I left it installed and then stopped using it. Then a week ago I read the <a href="http://lifehacker.com">lifehacker</a> article about using <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/bittorrent/hack-attack-get-your-tv-season-pass-with-democracy-204057.php">Democracy and TV RSS feeds to stay updated on torrents of your favorite TV shows</a>. All seamlessly. it is pretty dope.</p>

<p>This is what I have done (it is outlined in much greater detail in the lifehacker article):</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
    <li><a href="http://www.getdemocracy.com/">Download</a> and install the democracy client</li>
    <li>Find your <a href="http://tvrss.net/shows/">favorite TV shows</a> at <a href="http://tvrss.net">tvRSS</a></li>
    <li>Add the RSS feed from the TV show listing to democracy</li>
    <li>Hang out for a minute (go outside and juggle)</li>
    <li>Watch your shows</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>


<p>I was taking about  30min to download each show - with some taking much longer. It seemed that it was reasonably fast - especially when ran at night. I now just have to remember to watch the shows. Luckily democracy will delete old and watched shows after a specific duration.</p>

<p>So now I can watch TV on any of my laptops. I do wish I could throttle the Democracy player a bit more. It seems that having it run only at night would be a good plan. The coolest part about the player is how it is a bittorrent client as well as a player - so the problem of people closing their clients after they are done downloading an episode is a bit diminished. woot.</p>

<p>I guess the next step is trying to get <a href="http://torrentocracy.com/documentation.shtml">this integrated</a> into a <a href="http://www.mythtv.org//">MythTV</a> box. I think that would be excellent. And after hacking the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tivo#Controversies">Tivo</a> to all its ends - I think its time to <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/dvr/hack-attack-build-your-own-dvr-165963.php">roll my own PVR</a>. heh.</p>
