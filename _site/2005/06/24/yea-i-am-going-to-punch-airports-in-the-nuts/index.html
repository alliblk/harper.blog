<strong>Hi.</strong> I am an engineer who builds paradigm-shifting tech and leads others to do the same. I love using the enormity of the Internet to bring people together, whether as CTO of Obama for America, CTO at Threadless.com, or on my own projects. You can often find me playing with new technology, looking for something to hack, or enjoying life in Chicago with my amazing wife, Hiromi.

    <p>I hate airports as of yesterday.</p>

<p>It all started about 1.5 months ago. I got word that i was coming to NYC for some work stuff so i went on orbitz and purchased some tickets. about two weeks after that i double checked and noticed much to my surprise that i had purchased tickets for some random weekend in July. wtf. i have never done that before. i pride myself in being rather "good" at the internet and i am usually accurate in my typings - so i must have just flustered and fuxored it all up.  so i had to change the flights - which cost me a couple hundred dollars. so so so angry. so in my flummoxed state i inadvertently make a flight into La guardia that arrives at 6am and then a flight leaving that has a connection.</p>

<p>This wasn't a problem until i realized that my ride to "work" wasn't going to be there until 4pm. So on that sunday i did a whole lot of uncomfortable sleeping and yoyoing for airport workers. fun fun.</p>

<p>the week went by. fun. excitement. partying. etc. you know the drill. then i went to the airport on thursday.</p>

<p>I arrived with about 1 hour to go until my flight - went to the untied premiere desk and checked in. however, united had no record of my flight. i had them look it up and they notified me that the flight was in fact a shared flight with US Airways. This was fine - however US Airways is nowhere near the united terminal. So i wonder around laguardia until a TSA tells me that i need to take a bus to get to the other terminal. meanwhile time is ticking on my flight. i am getting frantic. i run around like a monkey and finally make it to the US Airways terminal.</p>

<p>So i am sitting there at my gate listening to the announcements. they are changing the gate for my flight every ten minutes and i am kinda confused. They then announce that a black IBM laptop has been found at security. So i glance in my bag and think "oh shit" and run off to security. The not very helpful security guard tells me that i have to go to the ticketing area for lost and found. so i exit the security/gate area and go to ticketing. they tell me that i actually need to go to gate 22 back in the area i just exited. so i get ready to go through security again - and i open my bag and my laptop is there. WTF.</p>

<p>apparently in my confusion, "flusteration" and annoyance at the general situation i mistakenly missed my laptop in my bag. how i did that is not known. but i did. So i hid my embarrassment and went back to my gate.</p>

<p>at this time i have no idea if i have missed my flight, where my gate is or anything. so i run down the terminal. I am running and i feel my legs start to become tangle and i fall all the way down and crash hard. i mean HARD. i get up laughing at the ridiculousness of it all and make it to my terminal.</p>

<p>I hear an announcement that my flight changed gates and i start walking. that is when i notice that i have just <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_7610%2F240620051236&img=Nokia7610%28267%29.jpg">ripped</a> my new diesel jeans, and <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_7610%2F240620051236&img=Nokia7610%28269%29.jpg">scratched my knees</a> all up and am bleeding out of my knee and elbow.  and... my new gate is right where i fell.</p>

<p>So i got on the plane, slept, woke up, got on another plane and finally made it to Chicago.</p>

<p>yea. all because i am incompetent at booking tickets.</p>

<p>NO MORE.</p>
