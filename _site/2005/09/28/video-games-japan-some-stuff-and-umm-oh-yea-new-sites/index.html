<strong>Hi.</strong> I am an engineer who builds paradigm-shifting tech and leads others to do the same. I love using the enormity of the Internet to bring people together, whether as CTO of Obama for America, CTO at Threadless.com, or on my own projects. You can often find me playing with new technology, looking for something to hack, or enjoying life in Chicago with my amazing wife, Hiromi. Check out my <a href="http://harperreed.org">homepage</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=harper" target="_blank">follow me on twitter</a>.

    <p>New York Peeps: check out <a href="http://movies.groups.yahoo.com/group/mediadiet-movies/">Heath's new group</a> for watching movies. and such. i imagine it will be a good time.</p>

<p>I have been playing with my PSP a lot more. today on the bus i solved contra. that game is damned hard. seriously. wtf. what kid is going to be able to do that. i barely did with the magic emulator save. screwed up. i also downgraded my other PSP so i could play homebrew on it. ALl i want is to play Y's but unfortunantly it totally sucks. haha. so sad.</p>

<p>Isn't it a bummer when you try playing a game that is a big part of your memory. and then it sucks. like.. really really sucks. i suppose it goes for anything. not just video games. but with skinnycorp getting their mame cabnit and me hacking my psps i have been playing a lot fo games that i assumed would be awesome. and they are not.</p>

<p>however. hero is awesome.  but i digress. i suppose it is like movies too. like when i watched the last starfighter the other day. that sucked. but it still held true to my memory. however. Y's did not. it was too slow - the music wasn't as ground breaking as it was when Sean Norman and myself played it in his basement. It wasn't mind blowing. it was just a really poorly done anime game on a really fancy device. whereas super mario bros 3 was an incredible game still. the graphics held up, the sound was still good. i guess where the games sat in my head is where the expectations laid. super mario bros 3 was always cheesy, always had simple graphics and had obvious eight bit sound. whereas Y's was on a CD. a CDROM. it had CD MUSIC!!! and maybe voices(i don't remember). and it was on the turbografx(pcengine) so it was seemingly >8bit (when we all knew it wasn't). so in my head it was the technical equivelent of a jet pack. FROM THE FUTURE. so playing it and realizing the jet pack a dude hanging from a crane was disappointing. stupid video games.</p>

<p>in other news. working at skinnyCorp rules. I am currently working on 15megsoffame.com. it is quite interesting. the previous developer was good, but we work very differently. and as all coders know - working with someone elses code is like suddenly waking up in someone elses room. it can be weird and a bit alienating. its pretty fun though. wading through lines and lines of code trying to get a grasp on it. then getting a grasp then using it. fun. we are about to get our mame cabinet. <a href="http://extratasty.com/">launch</a> a couple sites and really rock. ROCK! i am excited. especially cuz i think we are going to start doing some interesting stuff with my friends.</p>

<p>speaking of my friends. i am about to start an online store to sell high end world mobile phones. all gsm, all the time. good ones. i am excited. its called straightupmobile - check it out here. it isn't done. this is just a headsup. ;)</p>

<p>also. i am making a site that you will all be apart of. unless you suck. then you won't - but nobody who sucks reads my blogs.. right guys.. right.. ...
its called illlist.com. i will be sending out invites in a bit. if you are interesting and it has been longer than a bit let me know (i will probably blog about the invites being sent. so if i blog about it and then you don't get one. email me. ) it shoudl be dope. i am excited. it may lead to parties.</p>

<p>speaking of parties. i am interested in starting up a small agency/startup party circuit. something really small and chill. like a "this is our space" party. something where we can all network. network until we are done. it should lead to business.</p>

<p>i sometimes feel that one of my main skills is that of a networker. it relaly made me think when i read this article about a "<a href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/20030101/25049.html">master networker.</a>" I want to be that. i will be that.</p>

<p><a href="http://web.mit.edu/chachaoc/www/2005.09.10.Mohawking/index.htm">getting a mohawk</a> is very liberating. i promise. you should all do it.</p>

<p>most of the links on my blog i pull from my <a href="http://del.icio.us/nata2">del.icio.us</a> feed. how i love my del.icio.us feed. it is a simple thing that really helps me keep track of the internet. which is apaprently big. one thing that i missed about traveling so much and not working when everyone else is working is that i missed all the links that were given out in our <a href="http://corp.dopeman.org">irc</a> channel. so i made our tinyurl bot post our links to our irc channel's <a href="http://del.icio.us/corporate">del.icio.us account</a>. haha. i will never miss a link again. the source for the bot is at <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=code%2Firc_url_bot">nata2.info/code</a>. check it out for your own channels. i am NOT a nerd. i promise. i only spend about 40 hours a week on irc.</p>

<p>heh.</p>

<p>oh yea. i am really thinking about going to japan soon. to visit <a href="http://hirominakazawa.com">hiromi</a>. that woudl be exciting i think. she finally moved to tokyo. and soon she will have her own place. so yea. i woudl like to visit her. and if VOX ever pays me. i will. ;)</p>
