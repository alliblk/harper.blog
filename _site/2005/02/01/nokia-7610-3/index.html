<strong>Hi.</strong> I am an engineer who builds paradigm-shifting tech and leads others to do the same. I love using the enormity of the Internet to bring people together, whether as CTO of Obama for America, CTO at Threadless.com, or on my own projects. You can often find me playing with new technology, looking for something to hack, or enjoying life in Chicago with my amazing wife, Hiromi.

    <p>So on new years day i got a little “carried away” and got my Nokia 6600 wet. The joystick immediately stopped working and all hell broke loose. i was unable to do anything fancy like call or text. it was so annoying. so i got out my nifty little Sony-Ericcson t610 and continued my day. luckily mightysync worked for me and i didn’t lose any number nor was i down for any time. however - i was totally used to using the Symbian phones and i needed to fix my 6600. The first thing i did was take it apart. that did not work. it just made things worse. so i gave up, used the little minature phone i had and went on my way. of course i coudln’t help but looking for other cell phones. i decided after about 3 days to go and pick up a nokia 7610.</p>

<p>I went to devon and picked one up at this place called oversees electronics. it rules. i really like it. not only is it super fancy and cool looking - but it is quite a bit faster than the 6600. it also feels better. the keypad is kinda weird and i constantly have trouble with the * key. but other than that it rules. i really enjoy it.</p>

<p>the muvee software is quite something - my friends all enjoy me sending them fucked up movies that make no sense at all. i enjoy it as well. it cracks me up.</p>

<p>one thing that is super annoying is that i am unable to sync with iSync. wtf apple. i mean seriously. it isnt’ that hard to support native syncml in your syncml application. hah. stupid mrouter. i am gunna punch nokia when i see them on the street. other then the syncing issues (which should get resolved in tiger - meh) i really like the phone. love actually.</p>
