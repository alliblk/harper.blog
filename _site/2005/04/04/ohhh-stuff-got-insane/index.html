<strong>Hi.</strong> I am an engineer who builds paradigm-shifting tech and leads others to do the same. I love using the enormity of the Internet to bring people together, whether as CTO of Obama for America, CTO at Threadless.com, or on my own projects. You can often find me playing with new technology, looking for something to hack, or enjoying life in Chicago with my amazing wife, Hiromi.

    <p>oh yea. so stability, unrest and insanity are all ways to describe my current feelings.  basically nothing is making sense and everything is all screwed up.</p>

<p>the new zealand people are at it again  - or something. LAME. and super super annoying. i hate money.</p>

<p>i think i am about to go through some rather large changes. it should be interesting. and retarded.  i am not excited. well wait i am excited - but i wish that i was in control rather than not in control.</p>

<p>this weekend was fun. on friday i played nerd with andy. we will have cool stuff soon. i hope. i also hung out with elisa. it ruled. then  i did my taxes. stupid taxes. then i slept. forever. or at least a rather long time.</p>

<p>i then went to XO with claudia, john, todd and mark. it is an excellent resturant.  tapas style. jordan is a server there and marco is the GM. so it was a star studded night. it was john's anniversary party at redno - so we went and hung out. lots and lots of fun. so many hot girls. heh. and good music and fun dancing. then we went to crobar - where there were these crazy muscle dudes dancing. hilarious. totally straight and acting incredibly "mister leather." heh. it ruled.</p>

<p>btw. i HATE the forward and backward keys on the ibm thinkpad keyboard. it almost killed this entry. i remember a javascript cookie-ish plugin/hack for squirrelmail that would allow you to recover a saved entry. basically i think that it executed a function that woudl store the contents of your textarea into a cookie on every keypress in said text area. it would then kill this var if you completed the entry/email. this woudl allow it to pop up a dialog and restore an interupted email. it ruled. it also disappeared. i don't know why. heh.</p>

<p>i am gunna need a new laptop. and i am gunna need some other stuff.</p>

<p>i am going to pheonix on tuesday.</p>
